## Who are we, and why are we doing this?

MTGA is a organization founded by a few Altered Escape developers.

We felt that there shouldn't just be one option for emulation and began development on MTGA.
We are developing this emulator to offer an accessible experience, that is up-to-date and easy to modify to provide the best out-of-the-box experience for casuals and enthusiasts.

## Community
