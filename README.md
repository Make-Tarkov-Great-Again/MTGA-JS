## Who are we, and why are we doing this.

MTGA is a new org composed of a few Altered Escape developers and external contributors. 
We are developing this emulator to offer a accessible live-like experience, uptodate and easy to modify.

## Community

TBA, the discord is currently closed and under building, a invitation will be added in the futur.

## Contribution

We are open to any contribution, if there is a part of the server you would like to work on, some code you would like to refractor, or a idea you would like to share/implement, feel free to open a pull request and request a review, or open a issue and share you idea.

If you would like to join the team, contact one of the team members. (Nehax, ae-king or IAMBUDE)
