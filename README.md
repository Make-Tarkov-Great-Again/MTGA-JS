# Make Tarkov Great Again

> It's going to be great, so great, in fact it will be the best

## Who are we, and why are we doing this.

MTGA is a organization founded by a few Altered Escape developers.
We are developing this emulator to offer an accessible live-like experience, up-to-date and easy to modify.

## Community

Our Discord is undergoing construction and is only available to those we invite.

For the time being, any serious inquiries should be forwarded to [Discussions](https://github.com/Make-Tarkov-Great-Again/MTGA-Backend/discussions)

## Contribution

- Is there a part of the server you would like to tackle?
  
- Some code you would like to refactor?
  
- Got an idea you would like to share/implement?

  
This server runs off the latest LTS of NodeJS, v18.7.0. The binaries used are maintained by SIT: [Binaries](https://github.com/Make-Tarkov-Great-Again/Tarkov-binaries) 

Feel free to open a pull request and request a review: **We are open to any contribution!**
