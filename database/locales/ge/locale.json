Das gesamte Stadtgebiet ist abgeriegelt und alle PMCs sind im Strudel der Geschehnisse direkt nach den Auftragskriegen gefangen. Dein Einsatzkommando reagiert nicht mehr, ehemalige Einsatzziele sind verfallen! Nun ist jeder auf sich allein gestellt. Passe dich an um zu überleben, entkomme aus der Blockade und übernimm die Verantwortung für andere, um deren Leben zu retten.\n\nSei bereit, in jeder einzelnen Spielsitzung zu sterben und alle Gegenstände zu verlieren, die du mitgebracht oder gefunden hast. Beachte, dass jedes Verbindungs- oder Hardwareproblem dazu führen kann, dass du ungewollt das Spiel verlässt und dein Charakter dadurch stirbt.\n\nJa, du wirst sterben, wahrscheinlich sogar sehr oft, aber denke daran – es ist nur ein Spiel.\nViel Glück da draußen!",

    "5a8fd75188a45036844e0afc": "Wo warst du? Ich habe dein Zeug so lange wie ich konnte aufbewahrt. Ich dachte du bist tot und habe alles verkauft. Das hier ist doch kein kostenloses Depot!",

    "5a8fd75188a45036844e0b0d": "Bedaure, nichts gefunden.",
    "5a8fd75188a45036844e0b0e": "Wie ich sehe bist du in finanziellen Schwierigkeiten. Ich habe beschlossen dir ein kleines Geschenk zukommen zu lassen, eine Investition in unsere gemeinsame, strahlende Zukunft.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f563": "Now that was unexpected! Not the most important of deliveries, but thanks anyway. It's not related to business. This is, you might say, personal. Oh and just so you know, I won’t be found wanting, so keep it in mind for the future who’s best to work with.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f562": "So, you got the job done, great. Probably just bought the shotguns off some trader for cheap, huh? Well, whatever, they'll still be useful. We'll continue our partnership unless you screw up for real.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f564": "How did it go? Never mind, I know, a huge success. You're here in one piece after all. The interested folks passed a word they've done just fine. So I suppose it's a double bonus this time, one from me, and one from the those folks.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f565": "What, success again? Bit of a warrior, eh? The freaking Terror of Tarkov! Hey, don’t get me wrong! Everything’s done right, I owe you one. Important business is taken care of - I feel good. And when I feel good, proper people around me start feeling good as well. Got it?",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f566": "Gut, dass du da bist Kämpfer! Ganz schöner Schatz, den du da hast. Der ist eine ordentliche Belohnung wert. Dazu gibts noch ein kleines Extra dafür, dass du nicht gepetzt hast – und natürlich mein Wohlwollen und das ist unbezahlbar.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f567": "Man sagt, Geld erkauft keine Freundschaft, aber ich schulde dir was.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f568": "So ist es also, wenn man mit gestandenen Männern arbeitet. Gesagt, getan!",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f569": "Vielen Dank! Kein Wunder, dass Prapor dich als zuverlässige und verantwortungsbewusste Person empfohlen hat.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f56a": "Wirklich beeindruckend! Geradezu ein Atomkoffer! Kein Wunder, dass er niemanden verschont hat um das rauszuschleusen.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f56b": "Danke, junger Mann. Ich kann nicht verraten, wofür ich das brauche, aber glaub mir, es ist für einen guten Zweck.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f56c": "Wurde aber auch Zeit. Du hast einen wichtigen Beitrag für viele, wenn nicht sogar für alle, geleistet.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f56d": "Merkwürdig! Dahin ist also das Wasser verschwunden. Vielen Dank! Ich werde meine Leute informieren. Skier wird es sicher nicht gefallen, dass ich mich in seine Angelegenheiten einmische, aber was tut man nicht alles zum Wohle der Bevölkerung.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f56e": "You can be proud of yourself - even if you took lives today, those people weren’t of the best species of the human race. You gave a chance to survive to many civilians.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f56f": "I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I won’t even explain how much and at the same time how little it is, in our conditions. Most people would keep it for themselves, but you shared it with those who needed it. Thank you.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f570": "Pleasure doing business with you, young man. I will let Arshavir know about your success. Here's your reward.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f571": "Honestly, I did not expect that from you! With these plans, we could've found and sold—... Khm, sent food to civilians, but now all this wealth goes to Skier who'll just vend it all for ten times the price! How could you team up with this scoundrel?",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f572": "Can’t stop wondering at the reliability of your services. Here is your cut.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f573": "What a prick you are, for sure. Got a word you gave the folder to that medic after all. Fucking Savior of mankind.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f574": "Well, blah. Nicely done! Take it, as promised. Double-crossing is not for me. See ya, keep in touch.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f575": "So, jetzt können wir unsere exquisite Auswahl um Fleisch ergänzen. Danke, junger Mann.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f576": "Erfreulich eine Person zu finden, welche Risiken für das Gemeinwohl eingeht.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f577": "And this idiot said he wanted a job. I don't think we can get along since you can't do shit. Go on, buzz off.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f578": "Good shit, gonna continue working together. Here's your reward. I've remembered you, so drop by sometimes. Various jobs always come up, all of different nature, but people expire fast these days, if you know what I mean.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f579": "You’re a damn Pinkerton! Helped me out big time! So, you found my idiot errand boy? Well, screw him. If you do something similar, you'll get smoked like him too. Go on, buzz off, I've got some stuff to do.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f57a": "Ah-hah, now that was a stirrup if I ever seen one! I got word from all channels that some devil is at large and grounded quite a bunch of people. You rock, get your reward.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f57b": "Du weißt wahrscheinlich gar nicht, was du für diese Menschen erreicht hast.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f57c": "And he said nothing was there! Although they might be empty. Need to check. In any case, here's your cut.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f57d": "Wenn dein Werk vollbracht ist, zieh los und hab Spaß. Mal sehen was daraus wird.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f57e": "Damn... Apparently, I was wrong to count on you. Nothing I can help you with. I’m neck-deep in problems now thanks to your half-assed job.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f57f": "Thank you, warrior. Well, your hobo used to dwell on the railway, in the train car next to the big boilers, there's also a bunker near the railway. My guys used to see him often in that train car. Anyways, see you later.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f580": "How long I live and wonder still. How was he surviving all this time? He can’t put two words together! Whatever. Let's first disinfect all this and wash it with cologne, and then open it and have a look.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f581": "It seems this problem is not solved, but only got more complicated. Well, whatever. Come what may.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f582": "Ok, spitze. Jetzt ist es an der Zeit, so weit wie möglich weg zu kommen, während sie ihre Experimente durchführen. Wir können später nachsehen.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f583": "Oh, you bloody bastard! Everything down the damn drain! So much fucking effort just wasted! The hell is wrong with you? Thought you were a sensible dude, not an airhead. Ah, to hell with you, spoiled such a jackpot! No way I’m letting you in on something major. You won't take part in any of my serious jobs, that's for sure. Gonna get smoked someday since you love ratting so much.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f584": "Now that is right on! Well, now we’re tied up good, bro. Awesome that you didn’t chicken out at the last moment. Now I can fill you in on some real serious business.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f585": "Mir bleibt nichts zu sagen. Es macht mir Angst, wenn ich daran denke, wer und wozu jemand solche Chemikalien vielleicht benutzt.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f586": "Wonderful! I can already see how that nasty grin fades from the Skier's face. He will definitely be unhappy with you, but you acted for the good of the civilian population, so there is no need to be upset. Let this reagent be under the control of competent people, I will take care of the transportation. Your share, as agreed. You made the right choice.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f587": "Well, damn. Well, why the hell are you courting this Skier so? Buffs you with cash? Promised you a share? But to hell with him, and you too. Get out of here, don't want to see your mug right now.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f588": "Nicely done! My guys will show up right now and get this out in no time. Here's your reward, as promised.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f589": "Hello again, Rambo. We're receiving the fuel tanks signal, so your job is done. I don't know how you manage it, none of my business anyway, but working with you is comfortable, you're doing everything quick and clean. Here's your cut.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f58a": "My friends now know about you, great job. There is still plenty of uglies left, but we have only started. Here, the friends got you a little present.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f58b": "Nailed it, huh? Nice, grab your reward. I bet it's not the last job from my comrades, they really got interested in your Scav extermination.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f58c": "I understand it's no easy task to waste these douchebags in an instant like a fucking meteor. No big deal, just pull yourself together and try again.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f58d": "Look at you, a Punisher if I ever saw one! There's a rumor going about that some monster is dropping the scum in big numbers. My cronies send you their regards and some splendid presents.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f58e": "Wonderful! Happy to work with you again, you have gained my trust once more.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f58f": "Jetzt, da die ganze Scheiße hinter uns liegt, Neuanfang. Bis zum nächsten Mal.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f590": "Hm... well, alright. Old offenses are forgotten, let’s keep working. Just be careful around that Skier character, he’s a shady dude.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f591": "Mighty wicked, warrior. Grab your reward. Come back later, my friends have got some more work for you.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f592": "Well, I see you found everything. Nicely done. For me, this whole deal reeks of trouble, but as the saying goes, the money does not stink. Grab your reward.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f593": "Well, no luck at decimating the operators, huh? Okay then, maybe it not worth trying again?",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f594": "Wasting Scavs is no big deal, they are inhuman anyway. But killing everyone indiscriminately, even your own guys… That's rotten business. Get your cash. This is it. Told them I'm out of it. They know about you, so they'll contact you directly if they need you. Don't know about you, but I really don't like this.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f595": "Great! Here, take this as your reward. In the meantime, I'll hand this flash drive over to my specialists to decrypt it.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f599": "I hope you made our interests on Shoreline clear. Good work, mercenary, here's your reward.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f59a": "Good job, now it’s our turn to act. I will send a transport there, let them take whatever they can from that heli.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f59b": "Brilliantly done, the work goes on schedule. Dziękuję, mercenary. Here's your reward.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f59c": "Good job, my friend, I’ll let my people know. Now, how do we transport the generators to the base without attracting too much attention...",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f59d": "Amazing, great work! So, this means that the key is used for all their rooms... You can go now, mercenary.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f59e": "My contacts received everything they needed. Good job, will be glad to work with you more, mercenary.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f59f": "I hope you didn’t mention this matter to the authorities? Great. Here’s your reward.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5a0": "Good, my people are receiving the signal. I hope the tanks are still intact.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5a1": "Your promptness is amazing, great job! Hand in both the disks, please. Marvelous, here's your reward.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5a2": "I assume you don't need to be reminded that all this is only between us. If the Blue Helmets' reputation gets tarnished, you will have problems too, mercenary.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5a3": "Kurwa! Pardon the swearing, but the situation is just too bizarre. Although, it may even turn out to benefit us.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5a4": "Got any news? Great, then let's deal with those fanatics. We will contact you regarding that cult when the time comes.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5a5": "As I thought, you are a man of business. Now I know that I can count on you not only in assignments but also in financial help, he-he.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5a6": "Sehr gut, los geht's.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5a7": "Well, show me what you found. Hm, that is a nice laptop, how could they leave such important hardware? I'll send it for decryption.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5a8": "Amazing, the first half of the cargo is almost ours. We will look into the documents you provided, let's hope the information about the second half is there. We will contact you when we get the results.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5a9": "Tell me everything, mercenary. A hole in the wall? Does that mean that someone has already opened the cargo room before us? Regardless, I will send my recon squad to that room, let them inspect it further.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5aa": "Great job, mister. The Scav attacks have suddenly stopped. Looks like they understand what they did wrong.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5ab": "Good, we’ll check out who exactly dwells there. Contact me later.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5ac": "So, the car was there, no damage? No signs of attack, yes? We’ll run it through the database, I feel we’re in for more fascinating discoveries.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5ad": "The documents are intact? Good work, my friend. We will check the data for the information we need. Your reward.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5ae": "A job well done is a job well paid, mercenary. I’ll hand this hard drive to be checked immediately.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5af": "With all due respect, didn't believe that you’ll manage, mercenary. It seems you’re the \"sharpshooter\" for me now. I'll contact you when needed.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5b0": "Proper work, Rambo, grab your prize. By the way, you dropped some really important brass there. They shit their pants good.\n",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5b1": "Now we’re talking! Rouble’s dropping, and green ones grow like buns of a roadside hooker, ha-ha. Wait for a call from Peacekeeper, you freaking careerist.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5b2": "Großartig, kannst von jetzt an immer auf mich zählen.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5b3": "So you're telling me that one of the ambulances was parked next to the health resort, hmm... Something is not right here. Well, I will send my people there, they will take care of the cars.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5b4": "Do you have the documents? Let me have a look... Indeed, the distinctive doctor’s handwriting. Thank you, young man.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5b5": "It pains me to think we’re following the blood trail here, but I’m sending it for analysis anyway. Thank you for your work.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5b6": "Nicely done, Mechanic has received the propellant. Thank you.",
    "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f5b7": "Good job, stay in good health. And I also recommend washing your hands regularly, if there is a possibility, of course.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da52": "There is more work if you are interested. I think you have already understood that I support the civilians remaining in shelters, who, unfortunately, didn't have the time to get out of the perimeter. In fact, all your fights are just a means of achieving the goal for me. And the goal is to help innocent people to survive until the possible end of this nightmare. Or until the evacuation. You strike me as a more-or-less normal person, not an utterly devolved monster yet like most of your peers who come to me. Therefore, I shall ask you. I need morphine. And not for sale to drug addicts. I am a doctor, after all, young man, and gave the oath. Many civilians are injured because of your constant firefights. Stray bullets, grenade fragments. And there are women, and the elderly, and children. And they are not combat-hardened thugs, they can not, and should not, endure such pain, biting on the rifle sling. I know that USEC used to carry supplies of single-use syringes in their SUVs. Get me at least several of those.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da56": "Hello again. I have a temporary shortage of lasting foods in the form of canned meat. Can you help? I need a reserve of several cans of beef. And I know a couple of places where we could get them. From our Scav friends, of course. They used to have a storeroom at the gas station near the Factory - maybe there's still something left. Another food storage was somewhere in the dormitories, with more than canned goods there. But for now, I’m only interested in them, so you’re free to take the rest for yourself. Deal? I know that these two gangs are allied, but to prevent theft from the warehouses by their own people, their leaders have exchanged keys from each other's warehouses. So it should be pretty easy for you, I think.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da45": "Hello there, soldier. What are you interested in? Cash? Goods? Ah, you want a job... Sure, I'll give you a job... after you show me who you are and what you're made of. It’s the first time I see you and no offense, I don't give important tasks to everyone. Show me how tough you are in the field. If you can handle it, then you'll have cash, better goods, sweeter prices - well, you get me. Logical enough, right? Well, fine. Listen for your test assignment then. There are tons of bandits roaming all over the streets, we call them Scavs. Calm down, say, five of those parasites and grab a pair of MP-133 shotguns from them. Going to be your debut. Well, get down to business, soldier! Dismissed.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da46": "How’s it going, warrior? Still in one piece? Good. Look, there's a little job for you. If you pull through, we could talk more about trust. Interested? Look here then, soldier. I had a pal who drove a tanker truck for the Factory. Managed to take the family out before the conflict, but returned to get the rest of his stuff and perished. He lived in a dorm, the bigger one. Can’t remember the room, I was there only once and was wasted as hell to boot. There was a poster of some chick on the wall for sure, the rest is foggy. To cut the long story short, he had an old bronze pocket watch with a chain. Sort of a family heirloom. If it wasn’t snatched by anyone, then there are two options - either it’s hidden in his room somewhere, or in his tank truck. Find me this watch. I want to get them out for the kid - his old man was not exactly a dipshit, worth to be remembered.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da47": "Alive and well? Atta boy! Not everyone can boast the same nowadays. You can handle a thing or two since you're standing here alive. That’s good. You have an idea of tactics, so here is the challenge. Do you know the sawmill area in the Woods? Yeah. Some trusted people have matters to attend to in the area, but local scum who, in lack of good sense, think of themselves as masters of the place, keep interfering with them. According to my intel, there are at least a dozen of those dickheads, maybe more. I need you to deal with those morons, the others will run away anyway. The right approach decision should not be a problem for a mercenary like you. To work then, soldier.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da48": "Stay well, fighter. Still in our sinful world, I see? But enough of that. There is this one thing. Rather sensitive, so to say. We kind of reached mutual trust with you, right? So I’ll be trusting you with a serious task now. I won’t go into details of why, who and for what, it's not really related to the task anyway. And the task is to procure a package and move it to another place. Doesn’t sound hard, but there is a nuance. The pickup is on Customs, and the drop-off is in the Factory. Customs has a big warehouse, the red one, near the garages. The package is located there on the second floor in the office. Grab it and stash it on Factory, in a metal shack on the second floor, near the dressing room area. Interested?",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da49": "Good day to you, warrior. Step inside. There’s a job to do if you’re interested. Need to find one piece of crap, and I’m at my wits’ end how. Briefly - one of the foremen who worked on that fucking Polikim has just in time laid his hands on some pretty important documents. You know, of course, how hard is everyone still gunning for any evidence on TerraGroup and its associates? Exactly. But the folks who tried to get the info out of that foreman happened to be more edgy than smart. The dude’s ticker stopped ticking before his tongue started wagging. Can you imagine? What dimwits! How do you do business with the likes of them? Okay, back to the point. So he grabbed the docs and stashed them somewhere. Asked around a bit, those who worked with him before. In general, chances don’t look too good, but who knows how lucky you can get? In a word, that foreman worked in the chemo shop. The shitmost shit, see. And somewhere on the Customs premises he and his homies had their bunkhouses. Eating there, chilling, most certainly inviting girl over, well, you get it. I figure it’s holed up there somewhere, most likely. If it’s not there, then we won’t find crap at all. So, I want you to search the shacks on Customs and bring me these documents. I think it's best to search for the locked ones.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da4a": "Hey there, warrior. Still fighting? Good. There is this job, a cakewalk, really. Obviously, not of your caliber, it's gonna be a favor, so to say. I've received an order, they need some 60-rounders for 5.45 AKs. I know there definitely were some in bunkers near the sawmill, my guys stashed some goods there before. But they got driven out of there by those TerraGroup people, who then locked the bunkers with a key of some sort. Well, if you're going for the bunker, you'll need that key, I think it's hidden somewhere in dorms on Customs, people have seen some TerraGroup brass there a couple of times. Anyway, I don't care where you find them, but I need you to get them fresh and untouched by some traders. And hurry up, the order is urgent.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da4b": "Come on in, make yourself at home. How's the life of constant battle? No extra preternatural holes in your hide? Jolly good. No freaking use for them, eh? I’m in a bit of a tight unpleasant spot here. Will you help me out? My messenger vanished. I entrusted a job for this local waste of skin, he played so tough. In short, I’ve sent a little note to Therapist with some proposals for a mutually beneficial cooperation. Nothing special, but nothing outsiders should know either. And so this meat sack went missing, and a little bird told me that this postman got whacked somewhere in the Factory. Why the heck would he go there, that moron? Told him to take the straight path. So anyway, find the body and check it, my scribbles might still be there. And if by some miracle they are, hand them to that medic woman, will ya?",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da4c": "Good afternoon. Prapor told me that you are the one who will help us to reconnect and find the lost letter. Great! I will be waiting.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da4d": "Hail, the knave of axe and gun. Some curious info came up recently. Smells like solid profit without running around too much. Ready? Look. There was that wisecrack who ran the stores, lived in a dorm by the factory. And, as usual, sidelined some cash. He lived in room 214. But that's not the point. I don’t think you will find much there if anything at all. Though he swore there’s something. Something else has surfaced: In the same dorm, he owned one more room, 203, but wasn’t babbling about it and, as a matter of fact, used it for storage. Now that’s where he had something of value for sure, more than one of his errand runners perished there. Also, he had a garage. Don’t know the number, but it was certainly two-digit - I have a listing of owners starting with 100, and his name is not there.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da4e": "Hello, mercenary. Are you interested in a job, by any chance? Very well. The job is not hard for a gritty man like you, and you won’t get a short end of the stick. I can always provide food and drinks, and, most importantly - qualified medical care, in cases of almost any complexity. And for my loyal clients, who do not mind helping me with my business, I offer preferential terms for goods and services. But it's up to you for the future. If you prove that you’re reliable. In the meantime, here's a simple task - I need to obtain a few emergency medical care kits. They are called Salewas, the red ones. Know these? And as proof that you can get things done, I want you to find them with your own hand, not just buy them off from someone. It's always a pleasure to work with someone you can rely on.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da4f": "Good afternoon. I have an urgent job for you. It is important for all who still live or, more precisely, exist in our woeful region. Do you know where the chemical factory is? Doesn’t matter now what was produced there and what is happening there now. I mean, who controls it or who tries to secure it. I have a firm suspicion that some sort of poison is leaking from the factory premises into the groundwater. And because of the lack of supplies from the outside, we are all forced to drink this water. Do you understand? Even the filters are no longer effective. If we do not resolve this issue, nobody would need ammo and grenades anymore. To figure it out I need the readings of radio and gas analyzers, which should be in the factory shops next to the water pumps. Look for a small separate room right in the workshops and that's the place where it should be. If you don’t find it there, then look elsewhere, this is no longer my business where exactly you get it from.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da50": "Nice to meet you, young man. I have a well-paying job for you. Since you are already aware of the problems with the drinking water in this region and the origin of these problems, I know that I can entrust you with the following information. We found out what the source of contamination is, and we know how to stop it. We need a bit more time, but we will get it done. Qualified engineers are already on it, but until then we will have to live on the remaining reserves, which are very scarce, indeed. However, to my knowledge, some people managed to make hay and stock up on clean water before the contamination. These people are part of the gang which inhabits the dorms next to the factory. Several people saw them carrying large plastic barrels full of clean water to that location. Though I can't blame them for surviving any way they can, we need that water more than they do. Besides, the contamination issue will be solved very soon, so they won't be needing that water anyway. Acquiring this water will save many lives, so get out there and find where they store that water. We will all be indebted to you...",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da51": "Glad to see you once again. My people found out who was involved in all of these illegal operations with clean water. Thanks to your information, of course. In short, it’s a gang of Scavs operating in the Customs area. I’m really not comfortable with this kind of request, but there are lives at stake, and these scoundrels still go on with their dirty business. We need to properly scare them off, so let them die in suffering so they would feel what they've done and what are being punished for. Will you do it?",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da53": "I want to ask you for a service. Don't put up that look, of course, it's not for free! In a small dorm, yes, the one inhabited by those bandits, somewhere on the first floor used to live a young paramedic from the factory. Unfortunately, I do not know the room number - when my colleagues and I were his guests on the Medical Worker Day, it was already dark, and in the middle of a party, you see. Well, he was a young specialist, still an intern, but very enthusiastic. Planned to enroll in the Military Medical Academy in St. Petersburg. And in his safe, right there in the room, he kept a case with the particular new medical device. Issued to him by the employer. He tried to get out of town on his blue VAZ 2109 with Saint Petersburg plates. I don't know if he managed to get out or not, but as far as I have heard, he either got stuck near the gas station or apprehended by the military. In any case, I could really put that tool to good use. Come the darkest hour, and you might need it as well. Not that I wish for that to happen, don’t get me wrong, but... I assume you understand everything better than I do. I need you to find it. Oh yes, I almost forgot, we have common interests with Arshavir in this matter. He has a good product for you. After you complete the task, of course.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da5c": "Wanna take a side job in your main specialization? Hehe. What a hypocritical world! I served time for roughing some punk up, and my lingo gets me scoffed at by a nutcase who drops people down in numbers without a trace of remorse! And where is the justice? That’s right. As my prosecutor said, it's there, beyond the wall. And we are all here, as in one big cage. See the point, no? Whatever, I went off on a tangent. Well, this task is easy. A group of Scavs is infesting the factory. And one of their pins is a character who goes by the handle of Uruguay. What a retarded alias to choose. What a shame, who the hell raises such morons? But I digress. The objective is to finish his earthly path. But this is only half the battle. He has a lighter, sort of lucky charm. The gilded Zibbo, fidgets it all the time in his claws. Dropped by my place, and, sure, went on clicking it. And, by the way, he lived in the dorms, room 303. So, I need this light to be carefully dropped off in one safe house for somebody to get properly flabbergasted, and maybe take a hint. Got it? So it goes. That safe house is at the Customs, in a closed bunkhouse next to the trailer parking area. Here is a key to it. Good luck.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da54": "Hello, young man. Truly glad to see you. I have a very important assignment, not for everybody to take on. Will you take it? Then listen. Do you know the sawmill in the Woods? So, during the Contract Wars period, it was used as one of the makeshift backup supply bases for TerraGroup. And I am very interested in TerraGroup supply plans in this region. I think they should be somewhere on the territory as well. Try to search for the temporary quarters for workers - there should be a secure case for documents with a special symbol.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da55": "A little bird told me that you want to find some folder and pass it on to the medic girl. We have a business here, and I have my own interest in disrupting her operations, you know. A kind of sabotage, eh? Come on, bring this folder to me, and I’ll treat you right, send some proper cash your way, and there will be more trust for you. The hell do I need it for? Don’t play dumb, take a guess. I’m opening branches here, building up the operation, and quality grub from those who’ve been preparing for all this crap in advance will sell like hotcakes through my channels. But I’m rambling, come on, go on your way, I'll be here packing your cash. Oh, and don't you be gullible to think that this woman is doing all this shit for the good of the people, I'm familiar with her business.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da57": "Hello. Good that you are here. I have a job just for you since you are already familiar with it. Our engineers have successfully neutralized the chemical leak from the factory, but the water is still not fully purified. Although the only remaining pollutants are specific to petroleum products. We assume that this is connected to the TPP fuel oil storage next to the factory. Know these? It’s hard to miss, there's a big pipe there. Technical rooms of fuel oil storage and furnace facility must be nominally equipped with the same radio- and gas analyzers you found in the factory, if, of course, they weren’t stolen yet. Locate and bring them in, and we will solve the water problem in the region, at least for a while.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da74": "Hello my friend, how are you doing? Not exactly amazing, I know, that’s just how the times are now. My people have run across some really interesting rooms in the health resort, which are, unfortunately, locked tight. It is known that USEC folks were stationed there earlier, and we also learned that they stored the keys at the checkpoint, in a concrete bunker, North-West of the resort. Since they packed in a hurry, there is a chance you may find something there. Bring me the key to the locked rooms.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da58": "Good afternoon, young man. I need help for a good cause. As you have long guessed, I collect food, medicine, and other necessities in order to evacuate the people. I don't want to deceive you, this is true. And now they have enough reserves for the road. And most importantly, I’ve managed to negotiate through my channels that these people would be met and let through to the other side. Can you imagine? But only the civilian population, no men under 60. Therefore, the first wave will mostly be children with mothers and a few elderly people. Almost everything is ready, except for one little detail - we need transportation. We have several vehicles, just enough to carry everyone from the first wave, but they are not running. As I was told, they have been idle for too long and need batteries and spark plugs. Even fuel is not necessary. I will make a proper list of the items we need. Can you bring them?",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da59": "Kinda busy right now! Although... Hang on a sec. There is an urgent matter. There was a firefight about an hour ago in the garages across the river. Just where my errand boy was headed. To hell with him, he was a total moron anyway. But he had with him one particular key. A mighty complex key, I might add. To the door that can be freaking anywhere, you know? This clown was delivering one very valuable thing to me. The bastard hid it somewhere and locked it with this arsetormenting key and came to me to talk up the price. What a bitch! I even raised the pay a little for the smart move, but this wanker still hasn’t told me where it was and went to get it for himself. He was muttering something about a bunkhouse, so I guess he hid the thing there. Although, honestly, there's a shit ton of bunkhouses on Customs. Anyway, I’m almost sure he’s got smoked somewhere at the garages near the RUAF roadblock. Find the key, and then find me that package even if you have to check all doors from the center to the port.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da5a": "Ah, it's you again. Decided to hang on tight to me then, ye? Bloody awesome. I need to stir up some movement in our region. All sorts of outsiders keep popping up meddling with business, shoot, loot valuables off my guys, whack them indiscriminately. That makes me kinda unhappy, so to say, and it does not fall in line with my business concept. And to make it clear that they're in deep shit, fuck them up with pistols, let them understand that the pros are working. Well, go on and rake them \"operators\" of yours, and I’ll pay the bounty for each head, and even something extra as a present on top. Times are hard, and you have to make a living here somehow - preferably a good one.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da5b": "Hey there, \"operator\", come here. I have a con here. What’s with that look? Don't like the lingo? Yea, I did time, so what? Why the bad eye? Two stretches, first in juvie, second - two years in minimum security for disorderly conduct. Enough? We done with that? Finally, we can go without gracious word weaving! So look, there is this con. Can’t say it's failproof, but might be interesting. One drunken punk’s been blabbing that during the Contract Wars he used to guide several groups of VIPs who did not want to run into soldiers or cops. And I agree with the latter. It’s still possible to deal with war dogs, normal people are not uncommon among them, but cops are no damn good. Well, in the end, he walked through several of such groups. Oh and fool as he is, he still had enough sense to steal everything he could during breathers. Now that deadbeat swears on his mom’s name that he snatched two flash drives on his latest run. What was on them - if anything at all - he’s got no clue. And he’s been permanently shit-faced for so long that he can’t remember anything at all - no location, no landmarks, nothing. Anyhow, he says there were some bigwigs with the security, so might be worth a while. Check any campsite you find. I know that these paths have been beaten through and through since, but what if, you know?",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da79": "Our team always works for the good of the people, or at least we try to make it look so. The Blue Helmets peacefully deliver relief supplies to our region, but sometimes, attacks happen on us as well. That’s what happened to two Ural trucks that were carrying UN-marked crates. We wouldn't be upset if not for the delicacy of the cargo, this time crates contained a little help not only for the people but also for the USEC company. You understand that we cannot allow casting a shadow on the United Nations' reputation. Find and wear UN uniform (UNTAR helmet, MF-UNTAR body armor) and teach local scum a lesson. Also, locate the spot where trucks were attacked, mark them with beacons, and bring me several MRE ration packs so I could present them as evidence, just in case. From the intelligence, one of those trucks has to somewhere in the Health Resort area, but there is no info about the other one. I think it's best to look somewhere near the port area, possibly at the construction site.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da5d": "Polikhim hobo? The former deputy chief of security? Yes, I knew him. All this mess caused him some massive damage - took to drinking, degraded to a hobo. He's not a bad guy... Wait a sec, can’t he say for himself? Did he get whacked or something? Well, doesn't matter, but if you're asking about him, then there are some problems. Well, I knew where he lived, but here’s the deal - I need help scaring off the Scavs from the Customs. If you help me, I’ll tell you where this hobo lived.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da5e": "So, Sherlock, you want a riddle? You’re our pro on these headcrackers, right? Here, look. One lame hobo came around here. Either nuts of just demented, hell if I knew. All in rags, dirty head to toe, and the stench! A walking chemical weapon. Launched one on some vector, and where he goes, everything dies off. Hehe. Oh, damn, laughter through tears. But I digress. Just wanted to dispose of him, a bit farther away so the stink wouldn’t reach us, but one of our boys recognized his former homie in that pile of turd. Imagine that! Horrid things are going on, turning people from normal beings to such rubbish, and all for nothing! But that's not the point. The dude that recognized this heap of rags, said that he was not just a regular prick, but a Deputy Head of Security for two special sensitive zones on the Polikhim! Just imagine what kind of source could he become if he could at least remember his name, not just chew snots and mumble while slapping lips like a madman. What a shame! I don't know what got to him, but here's what I think. All this time that bagger lived somewhere, sleeping on some pissed-through mattresses, right? Right! You should look for that place. Need a hazmat suit? Haha, kidding. But if it comes to it, the hazmat’s on me, and not only it.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da5f": "Got tired of waiting for you already. The documents that you got from the den of this tosspot weigh quite a bit. Pretty heavy they are. But this is a damn dangerous stuff. And there is no clarity who will be the best buyer for it. And it's not even so much about the profit, as it is about getting some enormous fuckin' problems if we choose the wrong address. So here's the key that you found there as well, and try to dig up further. My guys said it's from a dorm room. And judging from the documents, our deputy chief was seen on the second floor of the first building, the three-story one. Any info you could find in this room can come in very handy, and the prize will be impressive.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da60": "That envelope from the dorm contained some chemical formula. And the flash drive described the reaction process. We found a guy here who’s good with the subject. So he said that they cooked up something like this at Polikhim, experimenting with some blue liquid shit, adding some other shit into it. Sorry, I wasn’t into chemistry at school! All these chemicals, valences, indecent bonds! Fuck that! Hehe. See, I even still remember some words. That was some teaching in schools back then! But whatever. It is necessary to confirm the experiment described there. And then this matter will shine upon us with new colors. This blue shit is abundantly scattered in barrels throughout the region, but nobody knows what it is. And nobody is too eager to figure that out either. But we will take our chance and find out. And make some profits with it. But this requires another stuff, It should be somewhere in the factory. There was a room filled with garbage - they had a laboratory there. Look for a bright yellow sort of syringe, looks like a pen, like a morphine syringe. Well, you get the idea.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da61": "Here’s the thing. This whole chemical stuff worked like a charm, and it immediately became clear who do we push it to. And the receiving party is ready. Only one issue left to resolve. Find more of these yellow chemicals. The crux of the issue was partly resolved before us - someone has already tried. Don't know, intentionally or not, but if you believe the consignment notes from the same docs, the whole box of that stuff was already tried to be taken out from the factory. But this cargo was not logged on any of the checkpoints, so I figure it’s worth looking for somewhere in the warehouses on Customs. If they tried to transport it, then it's most likely still in the car, probably a van. And not just one lousy syringe, but a whole crate. Look out for some markings maybe, the crate has them. Got it? Ah, one more thing. My sweet friends Prapor and Therapist popped up, poking around. So come on, better not turncoat now. Just a bit more and we’ll be running this place. Good luck, bruv. I'll tell about you to Ragman - he'll get some good helmets for you to buy.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da62": "Young man, I cannot stand aside on this one. I'm aware that you are now working with this so-called Skier. This disreputable man pursues completely lucrative interests and that is a matter of great concern to me. Especially all this story with secret experiments on a substance that you call the yellow chemical. The substance is extremely dangerous, and I have a major request for you, could you give up the coordinates of the chemicals to me? Yes, I'm aware of all the details of your adventures with the Skier. I would come up with good payment for that. Again, this is all just for the sake of our people.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da63": "Good afternoon! Our world is really small here - I found out that you’ve been teaming up with Skier lately. Let’s go straight to business - I need to know where to get that chemical of yours, a big customer wants to buy out all the crates for a good price. I don’t care why he needs it, I’m a bit tighter on funds now than I would like to be. So, are you in? I won't disappoint with the reward, of course.",
    "5abe61a786f7746ad512da64": "This mug looks familiar! Hello there, drifter. Good timing, I’ve been pondering on some business here. A little bird asked me to check out the area where there might still be some fuel remaining. Hot topic, you understand, not for just anybody to charge with. And here you step in! Lucky me. Cutting it short, you’ve handled beacons before, right? No rocket science - stick it somewhere out of sight, press the button, get out. Got it? Excellent, all that’s left is to find and mark the tank trucks. There must be four of them total. Here, take those beacons, consider it a token of appreciation for our successful partnership. Don't lose them though, any extra ones will cost you money.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da65": "Hello soldier, I have a job for you. Well then, it's about time we make this world a better place. The shoreline is under increasingly frequent attacks by different bandit gangs, this seriously interfered with my friends' operations. Help them with their Scav problem and we'll send a handsome reward your way. But I have one condition: you have to sort this one out using an AKM series gun, my friends have to see who helped them.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da66": "My friends were mighty pleased with what you did on Shoreline. And they definitely want some more. More profit in it for you, too. Some extra gear too, so go on, keep doing good things for good people. Ah, almost forgot. They are asking for half-masks, you know, those that Scavs hide their faces with. Grab them from the bodies, they won't need them anymore, but my friends do. No idea what they need them for, probably to make a point or something. One more thing, this time it should be done silently, with a suppressor, so that they don't even know what killed them. To work, soldier.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da67": "Hey there, man. Well, my friends are clearly up to something. Last time you dropped some Scavs, they called me almost instantly, and, you know, it seemed like they had a bit of entertainment going on. Making bets, making cash. Long story short, they want you to decimate Scavs again, but this time on Customs and using a good old AKS-74U. I don't really want to know what kind of show they are making of it, but they offer some top cash. So, you in?",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da68": "Weißt du, ich frage mich warum du mit so einem Drecksack wie Skier arbeitest. Auch wenn sich meine Türen für dich schließen, sehe ich, dass du diese unangenehme Situation klären willst. Gut ... Ich habe eine Aufgabe für dich. Erledige sie und wir lassen die Vergangenheit ruhen. Auch wenn die Leute es nur schwer wieder vergessen werden. Nur Gott weiß, in welchen Händen diese Chemikalien nun sind. Meine Kollegen suchen nach allen mehr oder weniger nützlichen Dingen im Bezirk, schauen nach Vorräten für die Leidenden. Allerdings konnten sie sich nicht überall Zugang verschaffen. Finde die jeweiligen Schlüssel und gib sie mir, dadurch hilfst du unserer Sache. Zur Hölle mit Skier, lass uns den Menschen helfen.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da69": "Well hello-hello, little rat. That last trick you pulled was total bullshit, that's for sure. I even thought of getting a team to get rid of you, mister fancypants. Well, since you’re here, I guess you want to amend for your sins. It’s simple to me, like taking candy from a baby - my trust can be bought. One million in rubles - and we’ll forget about past misunderstandings.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da6a": "That last chemical deal damaged my trust in you. I’m not the type to hold grudges, but that trick you pulled was very dirty, and I don't like dirty tricks. If you want to straighten things up with me and regain my trust - do one favor for me. The customer who expected these chemicals was left in a tight spot, and on top of that, I haven’t even delivered the grenades from the previous order yet. The grenades he needs are foreign-made, the green round ones, and I don’t have anything like that. Get me some of these - and we’ll call it even as if nothing happened.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da6b": "Hey, your last Scav cutting was off the chain! People keep coming and asking what the heck is going on. Turns out that my friends somehow negotiated with the local authorities - what’s left of them anyway - to set up some kind of mercenary fights, like gladiator battles. Can you imagine that? We just keep falling back to the Middle Ages with all this shit! In short, for them you are, what’s it called... a game tester, sort of. Whatever they are coming up with, they reevaluate and adjust it according to your actions. Long story short, I don’t really understand shit, but they suggest we continue. This time you will have a way more serious enemy, they want you to decimate PMCs, but you should be kinda disguised as a Scav, so cover your face with a balaclava and put on their jacket, at least. And also, you are supposed to scare off the real Scavs - using a 12 gauge shotgun. It's almost as if they want to start WW3. Stirring shit up and making others turn on each other... Are you in?",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da6c": "Masters - as my friends started calling themselves - are moving forward. Now they need the stuff for developing this whole gladiator thing further. Honestly, I’m not too hot on all these moves - I don't like how this keeps spreading chaos. So come on - find everything they need and just hand it over to me, I’ll pass it on to them on your behalf. Well, here's another thing, as proof that you didn't just find it somewhere, the Masters want you to make some noise on the Tarkov outskirts. And not however you like, but dressed in a PACA vest and 6B47 helmet. I do not understand why they need all this masquerade... These people are very shady, but I guess they have their reasons for your appearance.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da6d": "Hello, soldier. I don't know... I want out from these Masters deals. The PMCs are getting closer up their ass... And the thing is, they don’t want to shut them down, but take over instead! In times like these everybody goes a little bonkers, everybody feels the end is nigh. Anyway, that’s my last deal with them, won’t be doing anything for them anymore. Basically, they want the number of PMCs to be heavily reduced throughout the area. Gotta kill everyone indiscriminately: no info on who exactly is trying to be the smartass. The job should be done with an SVD so that the interested people would see who did the job... I don’t like it at all. However, the bounty is very fucking tempting. So it’s up to you. And another thing, these men have their own operation at the chemical plant, so don't go there to do the job, so that there would be no misunderstandings.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da70": "On to business. You've done quite a lot of useful services. Keep it this way, and I think I could let you in on the greatest secrets. We have one delicate matter to tackle, which should yield considerable profits. You've probably seen the Azure Coast health resort, a beautiful facility, is it not? The matter involves some activities inside, I can’t say more yet. However, observation data reveals that there are way too many Scavs in that area, their groups showing acute interest in everything that can be looted. Our task is to explain to them that health resort is closed for them - the democratic way - has failed and now it's time to make it the hard way for them. How do you like 12 gauge guns? You might think that this way of persuasion is cruel, but it is extremely effective. I know you are good at it.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da71": "Good day, my friend. While you were bringing justice, you surely noticed the helicopter standing at the health resort pad. We need to hurry and pick up everything of value that is left in it. For now, it's wide open and dangerous in there. Your task is to mark the helicopter with a beacon and, most importantly, find the safe path to access it with a vehicle, preferably through the woods. Mark it, I mean the path, with a beacon as well. After that, it’s Blue Helmets’ job.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da72": "\"Bless you!\". I remember that’s how locals greeted me when the Blue Helmets first arrived. My people are now engaged in a very important matter on the health resort premises. Your help would be very well-placed, as usual. We are missing some tools for this job. This is a very serious business, so you must make sure that the equipment is intact: resellers are not trust-worthy. Knowing your deftness, I think it won’t be hard to get the required items.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da73": "What can you expect when stuff like that keeps happening, kurwa! We completely forgot about the power supply: our local generators are out of order. My people suffer power shortages and it is totally not okay, because time is money. Many have carried out their activities in the resort before us. Search for generators that are still functional, they are most likely in locked rooms on the second floor of both buildings, we’ll need a bunch of them. Just inform me when you locate the rooms.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da7d": "Let's continue our work on the shoreline. A USEC group used to be stationed in the resort. After this mess broke out, they left behind a lot of goods, especially in locked premises. My friends have decided that this is a great place for the production of some compounds... After all, isn't it a Blue Helmets’ job to make people's lives easier? However, I only help with necessary supplies, distribution is handled by other people. I'll introduce you to them when the time comes. I hope all you have learned will stay between us. Now go and bring me what my friends need.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da75": "Good afternoon, mercenary. My name is Peacekeeper, and you were recommended by Skier, as a man who knows his value and the value of loyalty too. Let's not waste time and get straight to business. I need to deliver certain gear to certain people. I'll give you all the stuff I need to be moved, and your job will be to leave it all in a certain spot - on the Shoreline, next to one of the - what’s it called - breakwaters. There is a boat nearby, and that is where you drop the gear. Is the task clear?",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da76": "Okay, here’s the next deal. Russia has kindly provided the UNTAR mission with several Tigr LAVs. Today the mission has virtually collapsed, and the vehicles are left to rot in the rain. I need you to locate those three abandoned armored trucks on Customs and mark them with beacons. There are still many valuables left inside that can be salvaged and sold, for example, to American intelligence. I recommend searching for the trucks on the main road. Unfortunately, I don’t have the beacons right now, so you'll need to get them yourself.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da77": "Good day! As you can understand, the conflict here was rather serious and there is some heavy machinery left on the Shoreline. There are at least three T-90 of which I am aware, and I am sure there are many  military devices remaining on them, such as laser rangefinders for example. Those models are not for export, and equipped with optics for domestic use. My customers would be very interested in comparing it to the samples owned by them. From the recon data, one of the tanks was left left on the small land bridge between the weather station and the hydroelectric power station, the other one must be somewhere near the north-west bunker at the Health Resort, and the last tank should be in the village on the dirt road at the collapsed tunnel. Mark the tanks with beacons, and my people will do the rest.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da78": "Okay, next job. NATO has carefully studied the conflict even before the Blue Helmets force surge and sent several drones to recon. But local air defense was apparently against democratic eyes. Two drones were shot down over the coast, now that getting to them has become possible, we can try to pull out the memory block from these. They should contain information about all movements at the beginning of the conflict. This information can make a good deal with my partners. Find their impact locations and bring me the memory disks. We have information about the estimated crash areas: the first one has to be somewhere near the local weather station near the port zone, the other one is near the bunker in the northwest.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da7f": "The drives contained even more data than I expected. The cargo is in the resort, but the most important thing is that it got there after an evacuation attempt. Since the West tunnel was destroyed, the TerraGroup folks, covered by USEC, tried to take it back to the port, but it was already roadblocked with the T-90. Hence, they scurried to stow it away, like wise capitalists, ha-ha. We got to know that the cargo consisted of two parts. The first one - the blue barrels - is located somewhere on the first floor of the East Wing, the whereabouts of the second one is unknown yet. Find that cargo for me, mercenary.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da7a": "In letzter Zeit habe ich dieses komische Gefühl. Weißt du, du bist nicht die einzige Person mit der ich zusammenarbeite, andere Leute stellen mir einige andere Dienste zur Verfügung. Ein besonders wichtiger Informant, hat sich eine Weile nicht gemeldet. Die letzte Nachricht von ihm handelte von einem seltsamen Schimmern in dem Bereich des alten Dorfs und Stimmen die er gehört hat. Anscheinend entschied er sich dann, dem Ganzen nachzugehen und wird nun vermisst. Die Siedlung wurde bereits vor langer Zeit aufgegeben und besteht noch hauptsächlich aus Holzhütten. Versuche den Informanten zu finden oder versuche zumindest, so viel wie du kannst herauszufinden.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da7b": "Was du in dem Dorf herausgefunden hast, ist sehr interessant. Es sieht nach irgendeiner Art okkulter Sekte aus. Ich habe schon vorher Gerüchte gehört, dass es eine Gruppe gibt, die aktiv die Nachricht der drohenden Apokalypse und sonstiger Hysterie verbreitet. Nun, sie bringen ihren Göttern häufig Opfer und was meinst du, was sie ihren Göttern opfern? Waffen. Es ist nicht klar woher sie die Waffen nehmen, oder was sie den Rest ihrer Zeit machen. Wir wissen nur, dass sie mehrere Opfer-Altäre haben, überall. Finde sie, markiere sie mit den Peilsendern und wir werden versuchen Licht in die Aktivitäten dieser Organisation zu bringen, um zu erfahren, wie demokratisch sie sind.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da7c": "Our partnership has been quite fruitful lately, it's great - and I want to trust you more. After all, reliable people are valuable. It's time I let you in on a delicate operation I'm running at the resort. However, first, I would like you to prove your loyalty to me, bring me a necklace made from the ears of your enemies. He-he, just kidding about the ears. But I am serious about loyalty - If you want in on this operation, you'll need to prove your loyalty to me, and not necessarily with blood. You know exactly what I mean.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da7e": "Good day, today I had the joy of understanding that we have a solid operation running, and it was not without your help. Blue Helmets now have a tight ongoing partnership with locals in all areas of business, and profits keep flowing in. Anyway, business comes first, as your people say. You have already been by the caved tunnel on the Shoreline. TerraGroup attempted to move some cargo through it but failed, and now this cargo is temporarily stored somewhere, whereabouts unknown. Provisional headquarters for coordinating the company’s activities were moved to the resort when the conflict started, but, obviously, they are long gone now. However, I think it’s safe to assume that they couldn’t move out everything, and we can try to get some information there. The computer coordination center was based somewhere on the third floor in the east wing of the resort building. Find any information, if it is there.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da80": "We have studied the documents you brought, mercenary. Well, the manifest said that the second part of the cargo is somewhere in the Health Resort's basement, and locked tight. Search the basements of the west wing and notify me if you find the cargo we need.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da81": "Hello, my friend, glad to see you. It’s great you're still alive, ha-ha. As you can see, my people and I have assimilated on Shoreline, and we also communicate with our partners and customers from here. We’ve managed to re-purpose the local meteorological equipment to transmit signals. Scavs, however -- and not only them -- always try to destroy or damage our antennas. We routinely deal with communication problems, even had to install surveillance cameras. However, it’s common knowledge that those vandal gangs only understand violence. Your task today is what you do best. Explain to them that the weather station and the entire Shoreline is not the best place to damage the Blue Helmets' property.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da82": "It's good to see you, mercenary. Those very cameras that we’ve installed on the weather station filmed a lot of interesting things. For instance, among other things, they spotted a new group of Scavs. They looked like sailors or fishermen, dressed in tatters and waders mostly. Lately, however, they have stopped appearing. I am very interested in their activities as their turnaround seems rather impressive. Search the Shoreline for a place where they could possibly live and mark it with a beacon for my people.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da83": "You hit the spot there, my friend. My partners are very interested in what this affair could bring us. The Helmets inspected the place you marked and found out that some fisherman lived there for a while. It seems, though, he is long dead, and people on cameras are his friends. However, we know that he was friends with a certain person called Artyom, who was often seen driving a yellow Daihyn. Their shared business was somehow linked to the Russian military, now you understand why it could prove interesting? Artyom’s car is most likely still on the Shoreline's main road, I doubt he could've driven off on it after the conflict. Use the provided description to find it and write down the plate number, this will help us find this Artyom through the database.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da84": "We have run this Artyom through our database. It seems he lived in the health resort after the conflict and may have been connected to TerraGroup, but it is unconfirmed, no precise info yet. The nature of their joint operation with the fisherman is also not completely clear, but, considering how secretive their meetings were, I'm pretty sure it's some kind of military tech. We need to find where exactly Artyom’s quarters were, the info could be in the list of Health Resort tenants, which has to be in the administration office, if it is still intact, of course. Find those documents and bring them to me.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da85": "A job well done gets well rewarded. From the documents we've learned that Artyom lived in room 328. I presume, he worked there as well. Find a way to get into his room and if there’s anything left of his records, bring it to me. I'm waiting to hear from you, mercenary.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da86": "Hello, my dear friend, it looks like we are really close to an interesting deal. On that drive, we’ve discovered a partial blueprint of a missile engine that will be exceptionally interesting to the West, because it's deployed on the Typhoon class submarines -- which supposedly are not functional anymore. Also, there has been quite a detailed file on a sailor who served in the Baltic Fleet, a real salty dog, who is now in Tarkov somewhere, and it looks like he has connections to the Navy command. He’s the one we need to get. According to my intel, he sometimes secretly deals with the Scavs, and getting to him won’t be easy. You’ll have to work discreetly, from an ambush. There is only one chance of success, and it is very important not to fail and not to lose such a tidbit for our interests, my friend. My hands are even shaking a bit as we speak, you have no idea how important this is, and missing the shot is not an option. You're a great fighter, but I want to be sure that you are also good at covert operations. I need a sniper, and an experienced one, so come back when you’re ready.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da87": "Ah, that you? Ready for some serious business? Yeah, yeah. You're quite a scary character, scarier than me, ha-ha. To be short, the tourists are sort of bugging me lately... Meddling everywhere, wasting my people. I don’t like it. I’ll fix you up with some top cash if you raise some hell for them.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da88": "Well, since we’re now best pals forever and shit, I think it makes sense to let you in on a real business that real folks are running. There are orders from a certain dude. Peacekeeper is the name - I think you know who he is. Man himself is from the UN force, which is here to prevent violence, supposedly. Can’t help laughing, ha-ha! I roll with him from the very beginning of all this fuck-up here. Working here, peddling stuff, stirring shit up, and occasionally dropping a body or two. So to the point, he’s snowed under with work and needs a  tough reliable guy, just like you. Obviously, I have my cut. And, as it is easy for you to guess, the opportunity to work directly with an imported kingpin is not free. Yeah, yeah, off with that sour snot. Roll a several thousand bucks my way, and you’ll be doing business with all the benefits of Western civilization.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da8b": "beng beng",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da8d": "Hello. We know each other long enough, and there is no possible use for any disagreements now. I'm sure you're interested in our partnership as much as I am. Don't worry, I won't push your trust. I've come into contact with a person who has a large stock of Western medical supplies, and he's willing to sell it to me, but for foreign cash only. If you can help me out with it, let's call it friends again.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da91": "Good day, young man. Many people have tried to escape the current predicament, and some of them behaved like they were not human beings anymore, but for us, medics, nothing has changed. Our job is to save lives, no matter what the circumstances could be. When the shoreline tunnel collapsed, quite several survivors were injured. The ambulances were immediately dispatched to a distress call, but, well, I assume you know what has broken out there. Long story short, that’s where they stayed. I know that there were two or three vans, and the chances are high that most of the equipment and medicine is still inside... If you happen to find them, just mark them with beacons and my people will take care of the rest.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da92": "Thanks for your assistance with the vans. We were just in time, even those Scavs didn't have time to pull them apart. While researching the aftermath of the tunnel collapse, we’ve run across a TerraGroup executive's Geländewagen. It appears that part of the company’s top managers perished there while trying to evacuate. I’m aware that medical research was one of the top priorities for the company, and I'm almost sure that they had no time to evacuate its data and materials in time. Whatever they were doing, I think it can turn out to be very valuable, both for us and for medical science in general. It can earn us a ticket from Tarkov, even more than one. I’ve regularly met up with certain TerraGroup employees to discuss health care issues, so I'm pretty familiar with some of their works. One of my acquaintances, who, by the way, directly reported to that deceased Geländewagen management, used to live in the health resort building. Let me look it up... here it is, room 306. Search it for any documents that could possibly be left behind and bring them to me.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da93": "While you were searching the room, have you found anything unusual? Two bodies? Such an atrocity... It can’t be just a coincidence. No wonder, though, the documents that you’ve managed to find are dedicated to some serious research in the field of Immunology, and from what we can understand, they have made some significant progress in that direction. Judging by the signature on the documents, the research was supervised by the head of the Medical Service of the health resort. Quite an elderly person, I’ve met him a couple of times on Health Care Worker Day. Although he was a venerable scholar he preferred the repose of the countryside over the bustle of laboratories and often spent time in the Woods, driving around in a white minivan. Witnessing the success, I believe, could have motivated him to start experimenting on humans, the first one most likely being himself, according to medical tradition. Scientists are always like that. Find his vehicle, and, if you also happen to find his blood samples, that would be great.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da94": "Good day, young man. The degree of your deftness never ceases to leave me in admiration. Naturally, I wouldn’t want you to fall ill, so health before everything. I forgot to warn you that you have to be careful with the blood samples you brought. I hope you haven't cut yourself... and have washed your hands. Although, who knows how long it has been exposed to sun, wind, and whatnot. In any case, I would still advise you to pay attention to your health, otherwise, it all might end before we evacuate the people and ourselves from Tarkov.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da95": "Blood is a good source of information. Not as good as proper paperwork of course, but still good enough. It’s been a while since I did my last research. I was assisting an intern virologist with his thesis. Feels like it was yesterday, and at the same time so long ago. When the Internet was invented, it made it much easier to exchange information, even with colleagues from other countries. I miss this opportunity now to sift through the Scopus database, I am pretty sure that it has the answers to my questions, emerged after that blood sample research. Where could one possibly find access to the web now, you ask? To address this issue, I was advised to contact the one going by the name of Mechanic. As it turned out, he has access to the Internet, and it’s even relatively fast. I’ve asked him to look up the necessary articles for me. He asked for a small fee for his services, in the form of gunpowder, for whatever reason. It looks like he’s supplying someone with ammunition or something like that, but I am not really interested in that. Most importantly, he will provide the information we need. Find what he asks for, and leave it at the specified spot in the Factory. He asked to stash the cargo on the third floor in one of the locked doors. The door is quite fragile, as he said, so you can break it open without a key. The place is swarmed with Scavs in the daytime, so it’s best to do it at night.",
    "5abe61a886f7746ad512da99": "Who the hell are you, merc? What do you need? A job? Ha! Looking for a good net salary and a full social package? Looking for a job, my arse! Alright then. I can see by your mug that you can't do anything major, so I'll give you this: find me a white body armor, the one that looks like paper, and one Toz shotty. Gonna gear up my guys a little. But make sure to get the fresh ones, got it? Don't need no haggler shit. So anyway, if you do fine, we can talk further about your employment, mister \"operator\".",
    "5ac242f286f774138762ee00": "You’ve got it? Leave it in the corner, thank you. A beautiful thing, right? Anyway, I'm a little busy right now, can't talk for long.",
    "5ac242f286f774138762ee03": "Hello, mercenary. Yes, I am Mechanic. Let's get to the point, did you want to help? I have a lot of work to do today. There’s so little time, and the programmer unit for PLC100 is out of order. And those weapon orders... Anyway, here's why I'm telling you this. I build various weapons with modifications for my clients, and I'll need some help with it. I need you to assemble an MP-133, I won’t have time to build it myself, and I don't have parts for it either anyway. This gun should have more than 47 ergonomics, a laser designator, an extended mag, and less than 850 recoil sum. And compact, too, not more than 4 slots. Build one for me, and then we can talk about more work.",
    "5ac2430486f77412450b42c1": "Well, in the capable hands this weapon can overthrow regimes and create revolutions. Leave it in the corner, I'll check it later.",
    "5ac2430486f77412450b42c4": "You have not failed me with the shotgun, so you may know your way around tools. That didn’t save me much time though. All exchanges are on fire, hope it won’t start a panic. Nevertheless, I think it's not for long, so the plan remains the same. Okay, I need to work. And you, try to get hold of an AKS-74U. With a Zenit B-11 handguard, 60-round extended mag, and make it compact, 6 slots max. Ergonomics over 58, recoil sum less than 550, sighting range 100 or more. And, of course, as light as possible, 3.5 kg or less. Yes, indexes here have nothing to do with that. I hope you've remembered everything. See you soon.",
    "5ac2437986f774124836841b": "Handy for CQB and quiet... Good modification, the client will be satisfied.",
    "5ac2437986f774124836841e": "When I was a child, people used to say that it is not the destination that matters, but the journey itself. But what if the destination is yourself, what you know, how good you use your reflexes, and how many rounds you have in the magazine? This feels particularly true when you're supposed to survive, clinging to this world with your teeth. Well, to the point: I need an MP5. With a 50-round extended mag, silencer, tactical flashlight, and sighting range of more than 200. Ergonomics above 45, recoil sum less than 200. Maximum weight of 4 kg. And decide for yourself what is more important to you, the journey or the destination.",
    "5ac2438186f77412450b42c5": "Thank you, leave the rifle on the table, I'll hand it over to Di— ahem, Sniper.",
    "5ac2438186f77412450b42c8": "I’ve said too much last time. It happens when I’m alone with my thoughts for a while. A lot of stuff comes to mind while I sit here calibrating the sights. That M4 turned out splendid, got taken off my hands in a moment. A BEAR dropped by recently, goes by the name of Sniper or something. He needs a Lobaev DVL Saboteur sniper rifle, with a scope and multi-laser device. With recoil sum less than 400, ergonomics above 40, and weight below 6.7 kg. He said it needs to be a 2000m shot. The guy is serious, so do your best to make a solid build.",
    "5ac244ce86f7741356335aed": "Yeah, you can't hide from something like this. Love 7.62, a good caliber. Thanks for the work.",
    "5ac244ce86f7741356335af0": "Are you good at hiding? Not good enough for Sniper not to find you, I think. I don't envy the guy, what’s his name, Brendan I think. Interesting, all those heroes of the past who we admired so much, where have they all gone? Why has everybody become so empty? Why now, with this chaos around, such folk as Sniper became heroes for us? Why have we been ignoring such war dogs, and now we’re looking forward to being friends with them? What do you think? I have another order, for an R11 RSASS. With a sighting range of 1500 or above. Weight 6.7 kg or less. Also needs a silencer, ergonomics more than 26, and recoil sum less than 300.",
    "5ac345e886f7741d632339f0": "You're quicker than i thought, good job. I'm almost finished with cooling.\n",
    "5ac244f386f7741356335af3": "Hand it over, let's check out your build. Yeah, the weapon of democracy... Thank you.",
    "5ac244f386f7741356335af6": "Sometimes I think it's good that I got stuck here in Tarkov. The whole world feels like it’s descending into an abyss, a gaping, cold abyss. Everything has lost its meaning. People, their values, their thoughts, and their goals. They don't know anymore why they should take joy, work, have children. Everyone is tired from the illusion of choice they were offered all this time, from having to work and buy either blue or red cigarettes. It’s happening everywhere, in every corner of the world. But here in Tarkov, we are honest with ourselves. We see it all in an already exaggerated way, without false values, when you don't just decide what laundry detergent is better at removing stains, but how to keep warm at night and where to find ammo to deal with the next lowlife who wants to kill you. Only in such an honest society, people show their true selves. What do you think? Okay, thanks for hearing me out. Some folks requested a fully packed M4. They need a silencer, 60-round extended mag, ergonomics above 47, and recoil sum less than 300. And mind the weight, no more than 3.8 kg, with a sighting range of 800 or beyond.",
    "5ac345e886f7741d632339f3": "The other day, someone has decided to crash the market by unloading a thick wad of bitcoins. So thick that TARGox started accepting bids 10 times cheaper than the market value. Bids queue kept going while being constantly replenished with even cheaper bids. I managed to buy a couple of hundreds by chance. And today the price is back to normal as if nothing had happened. We need to get into that action while the market is being controlled like this. You already know the Factory well, there are some control boards there. To find them, look for the red emergency lights. Take a couple of toolsets and repair the panels. I'll work on the cooling system in the meantime.",
    "5ac3461486f7741d6224abb8": "Great, give them here. Hm, should be sufficient for the start, thank you.",
    "5ac3461486f7741d6224abbb": "I think you’ve already guessed that I’m building a bitcoin farm. Thanks to the satellite \"Ebambium\", it’s not all surfing and memes. The more time you spend online, the more you realize the new age is upon us. The change in data distribution speed changed everything. The world has entered a new industrial revolution, though it has moved on from the real world into the virtual one. We create whole worlds, with their own economies and laws. And, looking at what is happening around us I'm almost sure the digital world is more honest and better than real. Much more depends on yourself here. It doesn’t matter just as much where you were born and who your parents were. Okay, I’m almost done with the power supply. Just need a few more details. Bring over some cables, tee-connectors, and line peripherals.",
    "5ac3463486f7741d6118b985": "Just as expected - in chaos, valuables could be right under the nose and people will still overlook it.",
    "5ac3463486f7741d6118b988": "Before the conflict, I frequently ordered stuff online. Used to come regularly, I even put together a drone from parts once. The last order was 4 sets of computer components. Only 2 have made it to the city, and those are stuck somewhere in the Customs area. Now, as you can perceive, they would really come in handy. Try to search the seized goods warehouse, it's a big red hangar building. There was a big confusion there, so the cargo could still be there.",
    "5ac3465286f7741d6118b98a": "Ah, you've returned. I'll try to assemble them till nightfall, thanks. I know, it's really hard to find such electronics during these hard times, but I didn't doubt you.",
    "5ac3465286f7741d6118b98d": "Yesterday, as I was installing a reflex sight onto an M4, I spotted some weird local on the monitor, he seemed to be praying. He painted different signs on the wall and on the floor, then walked into the middle of the circle these symbols formed, and started placing weapons there. To be honest, it didn’t even look strange, it made perfect sense to me. It’s natural for people to offer the most valuable things they have to their gods, and these days it’s weapons. Those are cultists, you might've already encountered them. I have enough power capacity for now. Look for some more graphics cards and coolers. And thanks for the package, by the way.",
    "5ac3468b86f7741d6118b98f": "I've checked the frequency, the signal is definitely being blocked by those towers. I just don't understand why would someone need that...",
    "5ac3468b86f7741d6118b992": "Yesterday, someone was banging at the closed door in the kitchen. Sounds weird, right? I absolutely understand that this was impossible, but there was a sort of irrational fear inside me. Like when you're afraid of monsters under the bed as a child. I think such fears grow stronger the farther away you are from civilization. When you're among others, as part of the society, even if you find a monster under the bed, you can tell someone about it. But when you're alone in the dark every day, it doesn’t work that way. I’ll tell you what that \"monster\" was next time since the irregularities didn’t end with it. For example, someone’s jamming my signal, presumably from the Shoreline territory. It’s a hard trick to pull without powerful antennas. Try to look for satellite dishes, they most likely use something that looks similar. There should be at least two, about 400-450 meters away from each other.",
    "5ac346ba86f7741d6118b996": "I’ll manage the assembly soon, not as soon as Electronik, of course, but we won’t bother him for now. Thank you.",
    "5ac346ba86f7741d6118b999": "I promised to tell you about that \"monster\" from the other day. It was a failed controller, it flipped out and it sounded as if someone knocked at the door. That's how we create fears for ourselves. Interestingly, if I didn’t go and check what that was, it would be turned off in 15 minutes by the shutdown relay. After that, it would be extremely difficult to determine the source of the night sound. That’s how all those stories from newspapers are born, I assume. I can bypass the signal jammers by reconfiguring their frequency without raising suspicion of their owner as if things are still the same as they were. I need a few electronics for this and I think you can help me with this. The materials must be found silently so no one would get to know about what are we working on, only God knows, who might be involved in this. Here's the list of needed details, you probably know where to find them.",
    "5ac346d786f7741d645149ef": "Great, the signal is clear. The neural network works stably, I’ll try to find these vermins there.",
    "5ac346d786f7741d645149f2": "I’ve recently tried to build a neural network to control the cameras. Teaching it to differentiate between faces and look for matches in the database didn’t take much time. Then I wondered, what if we ever create a mind, which will realize itself, what it will be like? In the last many years of civilization, humans kept becoming more humane. They started treating each other better, started caring for nature, animals. An opinion was formed that principles of human duty go side by side with highly developed civilization and reason. Then, shall it turn out that the mind of the computer, which of course will very quickly evolve into an over-mind due to its high learning capabilities, will also be most humane at the same time? Interesting, right? But we need to deal with these pests already. Install suppressors on the antennas you found, and, just in case, another one on the tower, also there on the Shoreline.",
    "5ac346ee86f7741d6224abca": "Seventh digit after the decimal separator in the pi number? IIO? Okay, when the time comes, I'll contact you.",
    "5ac346ee86f7741d6224abcd": "I've been thinking about that thing we discussed last time. Have people really become kinder with the development of civilization? Do they really go hand in hand? All this time, where we believe there is civilization, life has become more comfortable, easier. There were increasingly fewer worries about safety or getting something to eat. It's easy to be humane when nothing is threatening you. The answer to these questions was right before my eyes. The situation in Tarkov has shown us how much kinder we have become. Once the issues of survival came to the front, it turned out that decent people aren’t more common than maybe 500 years ago. There're probably even fewer of them now. What do you think, are you one of them? Okay, don’t overthink it. I need you to do something for me. However, you will need to remember quite a lot for this job. Practice memorizing large volumes of information, I’ll contact you later.",
    "5ac3475b86f7741d6224abd5": "Great, now I've got something to smoke in my free time. Thank you, mercenary.",
    "5ac3475b86f7741d6224abd8": "Hello, come here a minute. I need to lay the wiring today, and plan for high power capacity, especially considering the continuous load on the grid. But that’s not the issue now, bring me some cigarettes. I want to work it hard until it’s done, and don't want to get distracted with searching. I know, smoking’s going to kill me. But is it really important though? Well, anyway, I need around 20 packs, preferably different ones. Oh, and make sure you get the new sealed ones, so look for them yourself. Was good seeing you.",
    "5ac3477a86f7742880308194": "Good old Factory has sure changed, but you've brought good news. The sealed doors are still there...",
    "5ac3477a86f7742880308197": "Someday we will get rid of the invisible hand, which used to brand us with employee badges and now has caused this mess, and I think it leads us to a great war. At least, all current events look like preconditions to it. I worked here for the chemical plant, as an ordinary foreman. It was a good time, everyone thought so, including me. Now it’s full of Scavs and swarming with brigands and outlaws. I want to make use of some of the factory premises, find out what exits can still be used. Go there and check it out.",
    "5ac3479686f774288030819b": "Pavel Yegorovich is one of the few who stayed. I wonder if it’s because he’s military or just didn't have time to leave. Although, I feel he just has some shady business going.",
    "5ac3479686f774288030819e": "I don't like to pretend, although we all do. Sometimes in order to survive, and sometimes because we’re just afraid. You know, I'm not exactly much of a talker, especially with strangers, but you seem like a nice guy. If you managed to earn my trust, I think you'll come to terms with just about anyone. After all, only personal relationships will help us survive now. Speak with Pavel Yegorovich. When he starts to trust you, perhaps I will be able to set up the supply of gunpowder. I know, he's not a saint, but his gunpowder is essential for me.",
    "5ae326bc86f7742a41359302": "Great gun, a solid build. Looks like the cultists are planning something major.",
    "5ae326bc86f7742a41359305": "Just when I finally sorted out the stable Internet connection and power supply for it, the Government stepped up the game and started blocking half the IP addresses that handled most of the data flow in Tarkov. All that because TerraGroup allegedly uses \"Ebambium\" ISP to further destabilize the situation in the city and wreak havoc. Sounds like that cultist gibberish about the Ragnarok coming, don't you think? By the way about the cultists and weapons — one of them, with a lightning symbol tattooed on his face, asked for a Remington 870 shotgun. Equipped with a tactical device, Magpul MOE handguard, and a tactical foregrip. Ergonomics above 60 and recoil sum less than 500.",
    "5ae3272086f77444fd36f5e3": "A comfortable weapon, masterfully done, thank you. I'll let the client know the weapon is ready.",
    "5ae3272086f77444fd36f5e6": "How do you think, is all the suffering that befell the inhabitants of our city the result of the actions of the society, or a controlled process, and this is just the beginning? I've been thinking about this all the time after that guy with the lightning tattoo. Although I decided for myself that even if it’s someone's invisible hand, our society has deserved it. We have, by our actions, by buying sneakers or even beet salad, supported those who build laboratories and manufacturers, and then use them to plunge us into the abyss. Okay, I’m rambling again, back to business. Get me an AKM with a Fortis Shift grip, silencer, and 30-round Magpul mag. Ergonomics over 40, recoil sum less than 350, sighting range of 800 meters or more.",
    "5ae3277d86f7745b4246b38e": "So, is the Zenit AK ready? Great, leave it on that crate, thank you.",
    "5ae3277d86f7745b4246b391": "I have two neural networks, one scans the faces on the cameras and compares them with the database, and the other one monitors cryptocurrency trading and reacts to it. Today I’ve decided to create one more, which will monitor the temperature, humidity, pressure, and other parameters of my hideout, and among other things — respond to my mood. Let's see how it turns out when I’m done. There is an order for AKS-74N with Zenit parts. Ergonomics should be over 55, recoil sum less than 450, and the gun should be taking up no more than 8 slots. And most importantly, with an RK-3 pistol grip, PT-3 stock, B-33 dust cover, and DTK-1 muzzle brake by Zenit, Zenit all around. Perhaps, a gift for a former Saint-Petersburg citizen.",
    "5ae327d286f7745d3a7704bb": "I think i figured how to train the network! Ah, yes, this AK will do, thank you. Leave it somewhere in the corner, I'll look into it later.",
    "5ae327d286f7745d3a7704be": "I called her Lusya - the neural network, I mean. So, when I keep silent, it does well and even reminds me to get some sleep when necessary, but as soon as I start talking to myself, it attempts to distract me, putting on music or something like that. However, I trained it with movies and phrases from them. Apparently, such a reaction is presented to us in the movies as the most appropriate, but not for me. I'll have to think about what stimuli are the best to mimic real people, rather than society and its stereotypes. But I digress, assemble an AK-105 now, with a silencer and 60-round mag. As for parameters: sighting range over 800, ergonomics above 38, recoil sum less than 500, weight 4.8 kg or less. And compact, as always, 8 slots or so.",
    "5ae3280a86f77444fc552706": "Finished with the rifle? Great, hand it to me. I've got an interesting key here, might come in handy to you. It opens the gun store in Ultra, the KIBA store. It's got some great weapon mods in there, could be useful for our future gunsmithing.",
    "5ae3280a86f77444fc552709": "While I was busy with the network, I started to wonder how are we different from it, and when we can replace our short-lived brains with those kinds of systems. What do you think, will this time come someday? I think it will, very soon. We already don't know what processes occur inside neural networks, there is only an entry signal and the result of its actions, and how it has learned with its own internal rules, wiring up its own neural links inside itself. How is it different from us? Would you love living in a world where your actions get limited only by your mind and imagination? The truth is, I think, living in such a world would be no better than in our own if there is no goal. And where can a goal come from if you're immortal and omnipotent... This time we need an AS VAL. GL-SHOCK buttstock, AN/PEQ-15 tactical device, NSPU-M night scope, and a 30-round magazine. Ergonomics above 33 and recoil sum less than 200.",
    "5ae9e4fc86f77443f2500fe4": "Salam. While strolling through Ultra, you may have noticed how many cash registers there are in stores and boutiques. Salvaging them all is impossible, but at least the cash can be taken. Should be especially plentiful in Goshan, and it's not that risky. Should be able to just grab the spoils and go, but there's one thing: they are all locked. So I have an offer for you about that: get me the key from the registers, and I’ll let you in on the cool schemes I’ve never shown to anybody. Brother to brother. Don't care where you get the key, you can just buy it from traders for all I care. But if you want an adventure, I know where the key could be. I knew one of the cashier clerks in Goshan, the guy wanted to leave the city on the bus during the conflict, and, well, got smoked at the gas station on Customs. Probably a good idea to check it out - what if he dropped the key somewhere on the seat? Well, go on, brother, don't let me down.",
    "5ae44bfe86f7744d733e560c": "Welcome to the crew, homie. So, down to business?",
    "5ae44bfe86f7744d733e560f": "Good day to you, friend! That's one crazy getup you got there bro, who are you hailing from, nikes? Or military? Well, whatever, doesn't matter. No pressure man, I'm not against PMCs or even mercenaries, it’s just that the situation we have on our hands, in our city, is total shit. So I figured you want to do business with me? Well, first I have to figure out who you are, get used to you around, you know? Let’s start with some trading and see how it goes from there before we talk business.",
    "5ae44dd386f7744f1a7eb65d": "Shooting like a sniper, good shit. My guys are saying that Interchange is filled with Scav bodies and Ultra is quieter now, so here's your reward, you've earned it.",
    "5ae44dd386f7744f1a7eb660": "Just imagine how many folks used to hang around at Ultra, mommies with kids, couples, and so on, everybody stocked tight, too. Damn, felt so cool, a lot of movement went down, you probably remember if you're from here. But I digress into nostalgia, no time for that, let’s get shit done, yo. These days Ultra is filled with Scavs, stealing whatever they want, you know. Do the world a favor, clean Ultra up from those shitheads, so I could send my boys in. Gonna have a gift for you if you're down for the task.",
    "5ae44ffe86f774149f15f4e9": "Great, awesome, got some stuff to look into. Seems like you scared off those Scavs back then. I'll send my guys, gonna have a new supply.",
    "5ae44ffe86f774149f15f4ec": "You know, brother, I'll tell you what, clothes will always be of value. War or no war, people still buy that stuff. Ultra had a bunch of brand outlets, the ones folks used to hype on, and I could use the things from there now. Do a quick sweep, check if there is anything left if they’re not thrashed yet. Don't worry, I'm not asking you to loot any clothes, I just want you to check if there's anything left in the stores, we will figure everything out later. Just don’t go about rummaging through trash, remember, brand stuff only.",
    "5ae4525986f7741b747a048b": "Good, I’ll send some grunts there and let Mechanic know everything is still on. Here, got a little present for you.",
    "5ae4525986f7741b747a048e": "Hey, got something interesting for you, listen. A certain guy dropped by recently, goes by the name of Mechanic. A tight-lipped type, keeps silent all the time, you must have heard about him. Didn't buy anything but he said he's interested in fuel. And I remember that there were fuel tanks near Ultra, strapped onto the trucks, the ones with the German flag. I want you to go there and mark the fuel tanks with beacons. I’ll send some fuel to Mechanic, he promised to pay well. You'll have your cut too, don't worry.",
    "5ae4536b86f7741b747a04e9": "Beauty will save the world, as they say. Thank you, really helped me out, brother. The hats are gonna be sold in just one day, trust me. Here, take this as a reward.",
    "5ae4536b86f7741b747a04ec": "Good day to you! Everybody’s so stylish nowadays, folks come by asking for things that weren’t much of a hit even back in peaceful times. Doesn’t matter if the thing is hit through by PM like paper, they’ll still take it as long as it makes them stand out. It turns out, people are still having a life, want to party or whatever. Look for different kinds of hats on mannequins or shelves, you know, those like in western movies, and grab our ushankas too.",
    "5ae454ed86f774626b445ec0": "Taken off dead Scavs, I presume? Whatever, that’ll do. Everything is going according to the plan, so come by for the next task later.",
    "5ae454ed86f774626b445ec3": "Hi there homie, I have a solid business proposal for you. Don't you worry, I’m not bullshitting you, it's the real deal. Can’t say what it is right now, but if it starts off good, I’ll be sure to tell you. I need a big backpack, the purple \"Pilgrim\" one, and a ski hat, you know, with ninja-type slits. Look for them yourself though, no traders, brother. I need to keep this in secret, don't want anyone to find out about our little thing, you know?",
    "5ae4568186f7744a4c600479": "\"Shaken, not stirred\". You're pretty good, man, got the job done and fast. My thing is almost ready, just need a couple more items.",
    "5ae4568186f7744a4c60047c": "Hey, what's up. You’ve dealt with hats quick and clean, good stuff. Now let’s move onto some serious things, you’ve got to be agent 007 for this one. I need a couple of Gzhel body armor pieces for my thing, and the trick is that I need one to be fucked up badly, and another one in a mint condition. Get them however you want, it doesn't really matter now. Can you do it?",
    "5ae9b1c986f7743a5736fc04": "Got all three? Big thanks for that, did a brother a service. These docs could help with so much, you can't even imagine.",
    "5ae9b1c986f7743a5736fc07": "Oh, hey there, brother, I’ve got a nice idea: just imagine how fucking awesome it would be to have info on Ultra’s cargos. What was being shipped, where, and in what amount, you know. I used to work with records like these myself. Don't think there are any manifests for the small shops, plus they most likely were run by slackers, but the larger stores and retail chains definitely kept their records. Check out Goshan and other supermarkets, like OLI and IDEA, the docs must be somewhere in the offices. it would be mighty cool if you found some.",
    "5ae9b57d86f77432c81e2faa": "Found the docs? Big thanks. Hand them over, let's see where our little cargo disappeared.",
    "5ae9b57d86f77432c81e2fad": "Took a glance at those manifests, I have quite an eye for details! Spotted deficiency in one store right away: some large cargo didn’t make it to OLI and in big quantity. Looks like they carried some batteries, but, apparently, the guys got stuck somewhere. The logistics service usually keeps such things under control. There must be some records on the routes and the last status of the shipping at the OLI logistics offices. Go visit them and try to recover the records. The room is probably closed though, gotta find a key somewhere first. Well, you're a smart dude, you'll figure it out, brother.",
    "5ae9ba1086f77415a869b400": "Oh, you got them? Give 'em here, let's have a look. Whoa, why the fuck are they so heavy?! Alright, I'll check them later. Here, take this for the help.",
    "5ae9ba1086f77415a869b403": "Oh, brother, I’d be neck-deep in work without you. I'm doing it all so the city keeps on living, mind you, that’s why I do all the moves. Alright, I'll tell you about my secret affair, since it has been going so smoothly so far. I’m thinking of setting up garment manufacture, to sew and sell vests, holsters, armor. As in the best fashion houses in Europe, haha. This time I need to understand what exactly is inside the 6B43 armor, the green one, it's also heavy as shit, you probably know. I want to figure out how it breaks down, and what it’s based on. Just like the last time, bring me a couple of those, one totaled, and one a bit more pristine.",
    "5ae9bf2886f774703201f136": "Thank you heartily, bro! Put them somewhere in the corner, I'll take a look later. I'm done with garment manufacture for now, gotta deal with something else first.",
    "5ae9bf2886f774703201f139": "Well, looks like I’m through with armor, took a bit of an effort, though. If I need some more, you’ll help me out, right? Anyway, now I have to get my hands on tactical rigs, and some of them are pretty hard to come by, but you’ll pull through, right? I need grey BlackRocks and green TVs. Bring at least a couple of each, and it'll be fine. Look for them yourself though, no traders, okay?",
    "5ae9c05d86f77427153c7f99": "You really found them? Thank you, friend. Don't get any ideas, these books are very important, they'll help me with my business.",
    "5ae9c05d86f77427153c7f9c": "Good day to you! We already went so far together, you’re like a brother to me. Like family, see, don’t get me wrong. So, like a brother, answer frankly, do you like reading? I devoured books back then, as a kid. But now I need a serious book, for business. A rare bitch for sure, but I know you can get a devil from under the ground if you'd want. Get me the book about designing clothes from special fabrics, all that military stuff has to be made with aramid fabric, which has its own tricks to it. There should be a manual for them, in two volumes. If you can get it, that’d be capital. Should probably check in the book stores, they must be there. ULTRA had, as I remember, the \"Knigoyed\" and \"Museum of History\" stores, so make sure to search them both.",
    "5ae9c25086f77415a869b601": "Wow wow, easy there, I'm on your side, man! Sorry, I'm just fucking around. I see you have mastered your charisma, that's good. Let's talk about business then.",
    "5ae9c25086f77415a869b604": "Hey. I’ll tell you as a friend, that in trade what matters is how you present yourself, not being a dork or a nerd. Then, not only girls but also customers will love you. This is my secret, feel free to use it. I have a little business proposition to Elvira, the chief therapist at the hospital. But I can only trust you with this if you pump up your charisma because right now she won’t even look at you, no offense. We're gonna make a real man out of you.",
    "5ae9c32886f774703201f167": "Seems like it went without a hitch, thanks.",
    "5ae9c32886f774703201f16a": "Alright, so here's the deal. Here's the note I was talking about, bring it to the doc lady. Nothing criminal in there, just a few lines about our business. But here's the pain in the ass: if she knows that the note is from me, she’ll just tear it up on the spot. Try to gain her favor first, earn some trust, and only then pass the note over. And don’t lose it, I’m not writing another one.",
    "5ae9e06286f7741e755650a6": "So, how's the weather on Woods? I let Den know everything's ready for pick up, thank you.",
    "5ae9e06286f7741e755650a9": "Salam. Listen, I’d like to send a care package to one dude. Get him fitted with some stuff, just so he knows that Arshavir remembers. He's is not the military, just a regular dude, but he loves to dress up like he's in the Matrix sometimes. Or as that hairy-chested spy, Austin or whatever, the dude in glasses. Leave the package at the pier in the Woods, right on the wooden docks. He will pick it up, I’ll let him know. Just hide it someplace between the barrels, so that nobody sees it. Here's the list of what to stash, come back when you're done. Oh, the shemagh must be green, by the way!",
    "5ae9e3f386f774346013b844": "You're like some Invisible Man or a ghost or something. Hold on, lemme grab a map. So, the safest roads are here and here, right? Awesome, I'll let my guys know. Thank you, friend, really helped me out here.",
    "5ae9e3f386f774346013b847": "You scared off some Scavs at Ultra once, remember, brother? Now people say it’s getting worse. Word is it’s crawling with all sorts of scum.

    "5ae9e4fc86f77443f2500fe1": "Now that’s a true djigit! I'll assemble my guys, they'll bring so much good stuff from Goshan! So, about your reward: check out the new stock of body armor, all for you.",

He even broke his leg trying to jump-dive from the pier that day. Jolly fellow dreamt of setting up an airsoft field all the time. It seems his wish came true in Tarkov, the best and largest airsoft field in the world, with an only minor difference: here, you die and lose everything from a single stray bullet. Put together an AK-102, with a Rotor 43 silencer, Magpul AFG OD tactical grip, and the Zenit Klesch-2U flashlight. Ergonomics should be over 40, recoil sum less than 480, sighting range 500 or more. Make sure it doesn’t take up more than 8 slots.",
    "5b486ce586f7744882493785": "Come on, give it here, I need to hand it over to the client and fast. I hope you haven’t told anyone what this MPX is built for. Well, let's wish the guy luck.",
    "5b486ce586f7744882493788": "Okay, we have an urgent order here, don't have much time. Some guy stopped by, said wants to sort it out with Reshala, who is operating somewhere around dorms together with folks from the factory. Build him an MPX, with the Tactical Dynamics Skeletonized pistol grip, Annihilator flash hider, and Steiner LAS/TAC 2 tactical flashlight. Aim for a sighting range of 300 or more, ergonomics above 52, weight less than 4 kg, the less than 180 recoil sum. And don't tell anyone why you need this gun. If Reshala hears about it, he won’t be too happy, and his guys are quite a mean bunch, all served in the military before working at the factory.",
    "5b486d0e86f7744f4b12d78f": "Thanks, leave them somewhere here. I’m a bit busy right now, catch you later.",

How much of this was a concentrated lie? I think, all of it. There’s a request for a MOE edition AKMN. I.e. the handguard, stock, and pistol grip have to be MOE. All in black. Additionally, a Rotor 43 muzzle brake and Magpul M-LOK AFG Tactical grip (Black), recoil sum lower than 340, ergonomics above 44, and weight of 5 kg or less with sighting range of 500.",
    "5b486d3e86f7743780259fd4": "This one is for Sniper, it seems that he’s about to set out to the woods somewhere to hunt down villains for a week. Judging from the fact that he packed one hell of a backpack with an MRE, firesteel, batteries, and water. Left it at my place for now. He needs an M1A, fitted with an UltiMAK M8 Forward Optic mount, Nightforce ATACR 7-35x56 scope, Micro T-1 reflex sight, and a Holosun LS321 tactical device. Ergonomics above 20, recoil sum below 400, and a total weight of 7.3 kg or less.",
    "5b486e6186f7744a08514b27": "Hey, I have a task for you. Not complicated, everything's gonna go smooth, don't worry. My business is quite dangerous, as you have probably understood already. You, friend, are a good fighter, that's why you can safely come to visit me whenever you want, but not all my clients can afford such luxury: one was already found in a pool of blood at the gas station, for example. It appears that many are being watched, motherfuckers know they have thick wads. So clients don't want to drop by in the open, attracting more undesired attention. But that doesn't really hinder the business: If people do not come for goods, goods come to people, ha-ha. Help a brother out, get the required items and stash them for proper folks to pick up on Interchange. They need two sets of helmets and headwear (6B47 and Peltor ComTac 2) stashed in a trash pile in the Avokado store - you've already been there, you know the place, and they also need two grey Gzhel body armors, stash them in the garbage heap near the stage on the outside, it's near the Ultra main entrance. I'll make it up to you, believe me.",
    "5b486d3e86f7743780259fd1": "The rifle is ready? Great. I guess you have already figured out that Sniper's real name is Dima, I let it slip a while ago. Not a word about him to anybody, I hope you understand.",
    "5b486d8686f77450c05449c6": "Makes me want to put it on a showcase display. Masterful work, it truly did turn out to be a masterpiece.",
    "5b486d8686f77450c05449c9": "What do you think, how much does human life cost? Not much, I guess. But what’s even more surprising for me, it’s the contemporary art market. The value of art pieces by renowned artists grows every year. They are definitely talented, but the more you look at it, the more it seems that anything can be art. It can be a Rothko painting, a displaced urinal, or a bunch of garbage. However, in my opinion, the most amazing pieces of art are weapons, starting from the melee - which is already universally recognized as such and can be found in many museums - to an old AK or M4, which are beautiful as they are. But a weapon only transcends to true art when it becomes unique, one-of-a-kind, in the hands of someone who knows how to use it, who modifies it for his own needs, creating a masterpiece worthy of being displayed in the best of museums. Bring me one such masterpiece, an M4A1 with a KAC QDSS NT-4 (FDE) silencer, Alexander Arms MK10 rifle-length handguard, REAP-IR thermal scope, and a 60-round magazine. Ergonomics should be not less than 40, the recoil sum less than 250, and the weight of 5 kg or less.",
    "5b486ddf86f7744ba00f2234": "Oh, cool, give 'em here. Mechanic asked for it, as you've probably figured. I’ll send it to him today. Thank you, big help.",
    "5b486ddf86f7744ba00f2237": "Hi brother, how are you? At least you're in good health, that’s what’s really important. Besides the gear, my customers are taking interest in diesel fuel and all that stuff. Can you bring a few cans of fuel conditioners? They are usually used to improve the quality of fuel for the portable generators. I already have the buyers ready to take it off our hands immediately. I need new unused ones, so look for them yourself. See you around, brother.",
    "5b486e2a86f7744a08514b1c": "From the bottom of my heart. I’ll make the delivery. Such jewelry is always a pleasure to have, I think the guy will like it.",
    "5b486e2a86f7744a08514b1f": "Salam, there's a new sweet deal for you. Recently, I was approached by the guy who’s some sort of Reshala’s acquaintance. Posh as fuck, in a suit, and with a signet on his finger the size of a bottle cap. I’ve seen him at some gathering once, he used to drive a black BMW. He says that war or no war, his crib's gotta be all ornamented. Well, not exactly a crib, more like a hideout. Fetch me a bunch of jewelry, and I’ll hand it over to him. Look for horse statues, cats, lions, all that stuff. And look for Roler watches, the golden ones, it will be a complimentary gift: It’s best to be on good terms with such people, believe me, brother. Don't let me down, brother, or we're both in trouble.",
    "5b486e6186f7744a08514b24": "The guys said they got the stuff, nicely done, brother. Told you, all smooth and quick. As promised, here's your reward.",
    "5b486e8e86f77448824937ad": "Welcome back. The signal is clear, all good, I'll send the guys to salvage the cars. Thank you, helped a brother out.",
    "5b486e8e86f77448824937b0": "Oh, so glad to see you. Let’s go straight to business, I have to deliver stuff quite frequently, and carrying everything as a mule is hardly an option anymore. All vehicles are dead after some kind of EMP strike during the conflict. Nothing starts no matter how hard you try, even if you take them apart and put them back together, only cars that came from outside can still run. There are bound to be some minibusses at the parking lot at the Interchange, mark at least three of them with beacons. My mechanics will examine them in detail, maybe there is a chance of success if I procure some electronics from the outside. Just do it right, don't need no pieces of trash. Look for the yellow ones, you'll figure it out.",
    "5b486fbf86f77450c0544c16": "Oh, so you actually brought some? Splendid! Hands still intact after touching all these chems? I’ll get the eggheads working then, let them tinker with the stuff.",
    "5b486fbf86f77450c0544c19": "Ah, it's you... Long time no see. I thought maybe you got whacked, but, as it turns out, you’re a bit of a diehard. Whatever, you're alive and that's good, so listen here. People say there’s a new product on the market, some stuff in fancy chemical containers, like your gun silencer, but a bit larger. What’s inside them, whether it’s new drugs or just some vitamin B, no fucking idea whatsoever. And that’s what we need to find out, I bet that the blue-barrel shit from Polikhim is somehow connected to this, but I don’t know for a fact. These containers were seen at the Health Resort in the west wing first-floor offices, and one pal of mine claims to have seen them with EMERCOM people in the ULTRA mall, but he was in delirium at that time, so maybe it's just his imagination... To cut the long story short, find me a few of those containers, I have a couple of eggheads who might figure out what the fuck is inside.",
    "5b48700686f7744f4b12d7ef": "Nice, spot on! Hopefully my boys will recover, quite some gene pool they'll get from the new blood, but heck, they don't have much choice.",
    "5b48700686f7744f4b12d7f2": "Well, since you’re here, step inside, I have a situation here. These containers you brought had no fucking cherry soda inside, my guys who tried to open them got so high that they may soon leave this dirty world. Obviously, it’s some serious shit, but I still have not a shred of info on it, for fuck’s sake! Anyway, I need some chemo gear, ugh, what’s’em called, restorators or whatever, you know, the masks you put on your mouth to avoid inhaling crap that can turn you cold. Pick this shit up from those Scav idiots and bring it here.\nWhen the action in Tarkov started, Scavs looted all warehouses with this gear, and now run around in them like dumbasses, thinking it may help against bullets. Dickheads. And yeah! While you’re at it, find some kits for blood transfer, my eggheads are really bad. Don't care where you find them, but I need them fresh, not from traders. We need to fix my boys quickly, or that may be the sorry end of them...",
    "5b48704286f7744a14343905": "All this tech shit is clearly not for me, the picture is hazed and the signal is shit, but I’ve already spotted some “fat rats” while you were setting the last cams up. Thanks, huge help!",
    "5b48704286f7744a14343908": "Oh, whassup! Let me tell you something. I settled in around here nicely, but something just doesn’t feel right anyway. I mean, there’s no confidence about what tomorrow may bring! Forget it, I just caught some sads... Anyhow, I’d like to stay well-informed about what is happening in the area to feel more at peace. I’ll give you a hint of some shady spots where I’d like you to install some smart cams. So, I want surveilance over three areas: the road to port on Customs - stash it somewhere in the bushes near the blue containers, the other cam should be placed near the pier at the sawmill in the Woods - stash it right onto the wooden planks, and the last cam has to watch the Kiba store entrance, it's in the ULTRA mall. I’m not good at this camera planting stuff, so my boys will explain the details. The cameras can be found at Mechanic’s, he used to sell them, I think. Obviously, not a word to him about our business.",
    "5b4870a386f7744d06237e0a": "Finally dragged it all. Awesome! I won’t disappoint you either. So, seen any USECs around the cars? Well, doesn't matter.",
    "5b4870a386f7744d06237e0d": "Hey, get over here, I have a big deal! You have probably heard already that there are a couple of foreign drones downed in the area? Good people have asked me to salvage something for them, controllers or whatnot. I don’t know what that is, I, frankly, I don’t give a fuck, all I know is that they’re paying some good crispy green and obviously don’t want our domestic tech pool expansion. These drones are most likely already pulled apart, but it’s still worth a look. Keep in mind, that before they lost contact with command, USECs received an order to check up the drones and fetch the gyros from the abandoned Russian military vehicles. You need to search the places where they used to hang out. I know it’s fucked up to work for them capitalists, but such a pile of cash is stronger than my patriotism. I know the USECs were hanging around Shoreline in that Health Resort - they had a base there in both wings, so they most likely stashed the cargo there. Just in case, check the areas around the UAVs, they might've forgot something there. People have also seen USECs in the natural reserve, they were driving black SUVs near the sawmill. Well, you've got the overall idea, so figure it out yourself.",
    "5b4870d386f7743780259ff3": "Scavs eased up a bit, hope they won’t get too greedy and ask for more, but that’s my pain, not yours. Nicely done!",
    "5b4870d386f7743780259ff6": "Come on in, if you’re serious, got a new task for you! Those cameras you planted actually bore some fruit. Managed to find the right men, on good terms with Scavs. In short, I want to chum them up a bit, for the sake of peace. Because nowadays they are just too insane, these bastards. Wasting anyone indiscriminately, scared all my customers away, those motherfuckers. The trick is, these thieving bitches are from different gangs, and all need a different approach. So far we've settled on three gold chains for each, to get the conversation going, and we’ll see where it goes... I don’t have enough chains for all of them, but you’re a smooth operator, you’ll get them in no time. I'll point you where to stash them. Also, you should make sure the Interchange is clear of PMCs at the specific time, because otherwise, the right people may not reach the stash.",

    "5bc477dc86f7744fd57fafeb": "Here you are. Only you and Sniper can survive that long in the field, raid after raid, it looks like. He was recently looking for a reliable guy, who can be entrusted with a task and won't let him down. He says the best way to test a person for his task is to check their skills with bolt-action rifles. He's a serious man, so I think he needs a fighter for something important. What do you think, can I recommend you? Try yourself in as the \"Tarkov Shooter\". if you pass all Sniper's tests, I’ll arrange you a contact with him. So, here's the first task he prepared: we need to test your accuracy with iron sights from a medium distance, let's say 40 meters.",
    "5bc47a2386f7743920281689": "Not bad, not bad. Even I wouldn't be so accurate with my shots, I'm way too old now. While you were shooting, Sniper has prepared the next test for you.",
    "5bc47a2386f774392028168c": "My friend, Shabelsky was his last name, used to write stories about the war. Even I had a fun time reading them sometimes. So recently he sold the rights to the entire series of books, and they made a movie after them in the West. But now he wants more money from the movie company, he hit the hard times, apparently. Even messaged me to look up some decent fighters here in Tarkov. It seems the whole world has forgotten about our city... They only remember us when they need a hired gun, and while things are going good they prefer to not notice our situation at all. Anyway, I digress. Are you ready for the second task from Sniper? You have to shoot at heads and legs from the same distance, 40 meters.",
    "5bc47df886f7741e6b2f3325": "You have got a good reaction time since you're still standing here. Grab your new hat, as promised! Go on, shooter, new tests await you.",
    "5bc47df886f7741e6b2f3328": "I see you're quite a good shot, kid. Sniper said he wants to test your reaction time. The faster one wins, as he says. As in that film, remember, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", only with a bolt-action rifle instead of a revolver. Life here certainly isn’t a movie, but the reaction and the choice of position are very important in the firefight, especially in urban conditions. If you survive this, help yourself to my cowboy hat, I have one around here somewhere. You choose yourself, who you want to be: the good, the bad, or the ugly.",
    "5bc480f886f7741b09231869": "Ready? Then let’s get to work. Sniper took a big interest in you.",

I’ve noticed that many survivors do so as well, to some extent, and my guess is the crisis will only worsen. Especially with food, water, and fuel. Everybody wants a warm, dry shelter. I guess you’re in good luck to be noticed by Sniper then. He says he needs to test you at nights, on Customs.",
    "5bc4839f86f7746b5a283eb5": "There are no foul tricks in the sniper play. Good work, kid.",
    "5bc4839f86f7746b5a283eb8": "As Sniper likes to say: \"The best tool against a sniper is another sniper\". It is not a rare case in combat, but you have to keep in mind that the enemy is a well-trained and well-prepared shooter. They are smart, will take up tricky positions, and try to deceive you. Even if they're not a professional military man, but a former gamekeeper or so. You need to \"tie down\" the enemy sniper, make them show themself - then, they're all yours. Well, these are recommendations I was asked to give you. Scavs just find rifles with scopes and climb up on the roofs or rocks, thinking they're actual snipers. Those are the ones you have to eliminate.",

    "5bc4898e86f7746b7978fe32": "It seems that sometimes being smart isn’t enough to act smart. Well, a good old bolty can be of help with this. Sniper is silent for now, so let's wait for a little before your next tasks. I will let you know when there are new tests for you.",
    "5bc4898e86f7746b7978fe35": "Do you like classic literature? Why do you think Dostoevsky is so popular with those who've never been to Russia? I've been wondering about it for a while until this TerraGroup scandal emerged. Its executives, I assume, were very familiar with classics and what they do to us. Such a situation can only be pulled in a society where people can combine both lies and betrayal and irrational, unexplainable self-sacrifice, which are more abundant in Tarkov than in any other place. Dostoevsky wrote about it, these people can live with the highest commitment to other people and at the same time be the best at killing. Sometimes we forget about this.

My men got intel off of him and found out that he was leaking the info to one of the local crews, those that settled by the dorms at customs. The thing is, I want to give them some bullshit info on my \"next cargo\". And my men will cut them down when those pricks come for it. But this intel should be delivered with no fuss no muss, as if you were one of them, get it? You will need to stash the Flash drive with the special info, it's planted in the red car's trunk, on the big bridge on Customs. My guys got ambushed at that bridge, so they couldn't hide it anywhere closer to the dorms, sorry. Stash that flash drive along with an SV-98 and Roler watch in the dorm, just as we agreed. And the most important thing: do not smoke any Scavs on Customs and just leave quietly when you're done.",
    "5c0bc93186f77459d871478d": "You did good, now you got my respect! I'll keep you in mind if I have something interesting.",
    "5c0bc93186f77459d8714790": "Hey there, how's life treating ya? You know, sometimes you have to come in and shoot the shit out of someone in CQC, and you have to do it quietly and efficiently. I prefer 12 gauge for example, and I got no clue why the hell BEARs and USECs don't appreciate it, it's a straight caliber, you know? You just gotta get as close as possible, and if you have silencer, man, you can drop people and the guy on other side of the wall wouldn't flinch. It hits silently and it hits hard. You gotta master this, while I figure out what fish we could pull out with your \"talent\".",
    "5c0bd03386f7746fe16dbbaa": "Not bad, not bad. Perhaps it will be calmer now, plus you've made those bastards think twice before they decide to go lurking in the night again. Here's your reward, go get yourself some good sleep.",
    "5c0bd03386f7746fe16dbbad": "Greetings, soldier! Do you sleep well at nights? Fine? Well, folks in Tarkov do not sleep: I used to send my handlers at night and was sure that they would make it to the point of destination, but some smartass has seen this through, they pin my men down at nights as if it was in broad daylight, I've already lost three handlers to these fuckers. Long story short, I want you to thin the lines of these night gunmen, but be careful. There must be some serious folks with some serious gear, since you don't find NVGs easily these days...",
    "5c0bd95686f77479cf22c2f2": "So, what do you think? Some serious toy, yeah? Great, hand it over then. Here, that's for the help. Keep in touch, I might need more help to test some other things.",
    "5c0bd95686f77479cf22c2f5": "Greetings! Here's the deal, I've ordered a bunch of western guns from Mechanic for my clients. Guns are foreign-made, I'm way keener on the Fatherland-made guns, native product is way closer to the old soldier's soul and all. So, the gun is an M1A with a Hybrid 46 silencer and a Trijicon REAP-IR thermal scope, and I need you to give it a hard ride in action. And there's no way you just shoot some Scavs and call it a day, you will have to give it some real deal. I will give you one of these rifles, you watch after it! They cost a fortune, so if you lose it - that's your problem.",
    "5c0bdb7c86f77422c8027f40": "There you go. Now I'm certain you won't piss your pants if some shit hits the fan.",
    "5c0bdb7c86f77422c8027f43": "Hey, come here for a sec. As you can see, your fellow PMCs are having a hard time these days, weak ones don't make it. I tell you more: they seem like serious fighters, but if they're in some serious shit, they die like flies. Panic kills them, or tremor, or fuck knows, but the result is the same. So, since we are working together, I want to not worry about your back.",
    "5c0bde1a86f7747bcb347d52": "I admit I’m surprised. Although you seemed like a smart guy from the start, I'll give you that.\n",
    "5c0bde1a86f7747bcb347d55": "Do you know what is the difference between a professional and an amateur? It is the ability to approach the task from the right angle. For example, taking out a few capable fighters from an impressive distance, in non-standard situations... What's important here is not only the right weapons and mods but other factors too. So, Dima and I want to see who you really are.",
    "5c0be15086f7746f016734ab": "Frankly speaking, i wasn't sure you could do it. But it sure seems that you're no regular pleb.",
    "5c0be15086f7746f016734ae": "Greetings, mercenary. I've heard you're trying to become a sniper. Being in sniper business surely takes tenacity, patience, and a sense of purpose, but there are a lot of other important factors too. You know what Dima told me once? \"Everyone can shoot, but only a few can become real Snipers\".",
    "5c0be61786f7744525260758": "Did you bring it? Great, put it all down there in the corner. Careful, the equipment is very fragile. Even if the whole clinic thing fails, I know some people who may be interested in this equipment, but that’s between you and me. Why waste such expensive hardware?",
    "5c0be61786f774452526075b": "Good day, young man. As a doctor, I think that the Hippocratic oath must be respected even in such a difficult time. So, I have got an idea to open a clinic. Health care is always important and even more so in these circumstances. But where do I get the necessary equipment?  I will give you a list of what I need you to bring. And I don't need competition, so make sure you complete the job with no third parties involved. Of course, I will find a way to reward you for your work.",
    "5c0d0d9586f77433ec4de6c4": "To be fair, I did not doubt that you are the person I can trust, not only in work.",
    "5c0d0d9586f77433ec4de6c7": "You know, as a doctor, I treat people who have illnesses, it's my job, even in our difficult situation. However, since you sometimes run errands for me, I must be sure that your health is okay. Just to feel safer, you know, so I could be sure that you can see any task through. Prove to me that illnesses and physical conditions won't stop you.",
    "5c0d0f4186f774363760aef3": "Very good, very good! The clients will be happy with you, mercenary. Your reward.",
    "5c0d0f4186f774363760aef6": "Hello. As you know, there were different facilities, secret and not-so-secret, within Tarkov boundaries. Many of them are hidden, and many of them have already been ransacked by scavengers. My customers are very unhappy about this. It is in their best interest that technology does not fall into the hands of... undesired persons. Therefore, we need to take that technology outside of the exclusion zone. There can be no mistakes, I need original materials only, so don't trust any resellers or third parties. Of course, those people are serious and will pay serious cash. I'll give you a list of what you need to find.",
    "5c1129a586f774656777d1a6": "Now we’re talking! I’ll grab a soldering iron and get to work. Perhaps the market's gonna stabilize already by that time.",
    "5c1129a586f774656777d1a9": "Hey there. See what’s going on? Bitcoin plunges into the abyss. I don’t know if that’s a conspiracy or a logical pattern. This whole business was shady from the start, but well, there’s nothing left to do but to salvage what we can. To cut the long story short, my farm is acting up lately - bugs, freezes, and everything. Fix me up with some wires and capacitors. I have a little idea on how to improve the system stability. And make sure it's all new and untouched!",
    "5c112dad86f77465c36be0c3": "There you go, now I'm absolutely sure that you can return from a raid and with some good stuff in your backpack. Well done, brother!",
    "5c112dad86f77465c36be0c6": "Listen to this, brother. In combat every second counts, it's important not only to save your own hide but to carry out the loot too. Sharpshooting is science and all, but getting the fuck out after that and staying alive with some goodies is not that simple of a task either. It requires talent. You've got that talent, right?",
    "5c11412586f7745f60313bf2": "Thanks a lot, I'll send the boys over to see if we could get something drained from those barrels. How's the situation there, by the way? Seen anyone near those stashes?",
    "5c11412586f7745f60313bf5": "Salam, brother. So there's this guy, he was selling me some stuff he found near the lumber mill, and so he told me that he found some stashes near rocks filled with fuel barrels, can you imagine? We don't know if it was PMCs or Scavs who stashed them there, those barrels might even be empty, but it's still worth checking out. Mechanic throws some serious cash for fuel these days, he spilled that he has some kind of a farm that needs fuel 24/7. So anyway, the guy said that he's seen three of those fuel stashes on Woods, and each one also had half a dozen of green army crates. I want you to mark those stashes with beacons, alright?",
    "5c11424286f77461fd4d9582": "Do you have it? Great. I wonder what he would ask next time, a diamond-coated toilet? But hey, if he does ask for it, you actually will have to look for it. Thanks for the help, brother.",
    "5c11424286f77461fd4d9585": "Hey. Do you remember the guy who had some business with Reshala? The one we gave the goodies last time. Yeah, so looks like he's got a taste of the luxury lifestyle now, he wants some antique vases and antique teapots, I understand it with the vases, but why the hell could he possibly need so many antique teapots? Anyway, a deal is a deal, he pays well for it. Everything has to be fresh and untouched, so find them yourself.",
    "5c12350786f7745c8b0203ef": "My guys are saying that Customs is at World War 3 right now, BEARs and USECs are dropping Scavs left and right! Good shit, nice work. Here's your prize, as promised.",
    "5c12350786f7745c8b0203f2": "That fake intel worked out just as planned, man! Those morons wanted to ambush my couriers but got caught by surprise themselves, he-he. Although, now we're having some serious trouble with those pricks. Though my guys are not complete nitwits, some help would still be appreciated. So here's the plan: this gang has their own outfits, their key-fighters wear ushankas, Scav vests, and often use shotguns. What a bunch of clowns, aren't they? So what you should do is dress up like one of them (Scav Vest, Ushanka ear flap hat, and MP-series shotguns) and smoke PMCs. I don't care about factions, the important thing is to just get PMCs into this to fight those morons. You get what's gonna happen, yeah?",
    "5c12428d86f77406fa13baf3": "Good, limbs are still attached, and the needed noise has been made. You'll be useful in these matters then, warrior. Here's the reward, you earned it.",
    "5c12428d86f77406fa13baf6": "Hello, warrior. How are things on the front line? People say you're a good shot, I've even tested you myself too. But what if you have to use a grenade? You will need intuition and brains to not get flogged accidently. So, I want to see how you handle grenades, go make some noise in Tarkov.",
    "5c12457886f77468cf6f7342": "Now we're talking! Now I know for sure that I have the right person to work with, and I can be sure that everything gets delivered where it's supposed to. Here's a little present from me, in honor of our cooperation.",
    "5c12457886f77468cf6f7345": "Hey there, come in. Well, as you can see, it's rough times now, you can trust nobody. There are traitors and moles in every corner possible, but as far as I can see you are a good soldier, proven in action, so I can count on you. Now, I need to send some info from time to time and I need an appropriate person for this, someone who's trusted not only by me but by everyone else too. Speak with other traders, earn their trust. Will be beneficial for both of us. Oh, and don't bother Ivan Egorovich for now, he's got enough of his own problems.",
    "5c12a6a086f77456f7429b85": "Done already? You know, it actually worked, the way their leaders talk has changed a lot. Do not blame me, in this world you have to negotiate even with such scum. Your reward, mercenary.",
    "5c12a6a086f77456f7429b88": "I have a delicate business to offer you. A gang of Scavs is operating at the Interchange, and let me tell you, they are quite an evil bunch. I suppose the world without them will become a safer place. Think of it as a certain element of education. Perhaps these useless people could still return to the decent ways. But there is one condition - you must be wearing a chemical respirator or a gas mask. They should understand who is eliminating their people, so you have to work in close quarters. Leave one of them alive, let him tell his leaders who they are dealing with.",
    "5c13946186f774210563ecc3": "Ah, is that you? My superiors are pleased with the results! There are now fewer Scavs in the area, and attacks from the media died down a bit! Plus, we've made some nice photos for the newspapers. Good work, my friend!",
    "5c13946186f774210563ecc6": "Have you seen the news? Recently, media have been pushing the agenda that \"the Blue Helmets are not doing their job in Tarkov, do not follow the procedures\" and so forth... Those damn bastards, kurwa! I hate these journalist scumbags. We are one step away from losing financing, which, my friend, is the opposite of profitable for us. So, we need to convince the public that the helmets are actually doing what they promised to do. You must address the issue of eliminating the illegal bandit group activities but do so under the UN flag. I’ll give you the initial set of equipment you'll need, but if you lose it, don't come asking for more.",
    "5c13997e86f774210563ece0": "Very good work, you will definitely be a good guide! You will be contacted for further instructions later when the clients are ready. For now, here's the prepayment.",
    "5c13997e86f774210563ece1": "Bad luck... I know it's not that easy. That's why I need a competent person, do you understand?",
    "5c13997e86f774210563ece3": "Ohh, it’s you? Come on, I have some business for you. Some serious people who are, so to speak, new to the city, need the services of a professional guide who will lead the group to the right place and won’t ask unnecessary questions. They are willing to pay good money for this. Do you think you can handle it? If I see that you are indeed ready, I would recommend you to them, mercenary.",
    "5c13a99d86f77463932d9bc2": "You actually brought them! I'm pleased! Let me have a closer look at them.",
    "5c13a99d86f77463932d9bc5": "I have recently stumbled upon some interesting devices... The first one appears to be some foreign storage device and the second one is apparently a reader of some sort. Extremely interesting pieces of tech, let me tell you. And most importantly, it’s the first time I’ve ever seen them. Maybe some kind of import broke through the blockade or somebody looted a secret warehouse. It's clearly not domestic production, so my money is on the latter. And hey, you'll need to find it yourself since it's high-quality equipment. You can't rely on resellers, they would fool you for sure. If you can bring them to me, I’ll make it worth your while.",
    "5c1a4cc786f77435a060f47a": "Wo hast du nun dein Zeug wieder verloren? Meine Leute können dein Zeug nicht finden, noch nicht einmal den verdammten Ort {location}.",
    "5c1a4ccf86f774072447defe": "Ich hab mein Jungs bei {location} suchen lassen, aber keiner kam zurück. Scheint als wären sie Geschichte.",
    "5c1a4d5286f77431700f6134": "Also, so weit ich das beurteilen kann, hast du deine Sachen in versiegelten Bereichen der TerraGroup verloren. Meine Leute gehen da für gewöhnlich nicht hin, also solltest du akzeptieren, dass deine Ausrüstung verloren ist.",
    "5c1a4e1286f774072447df2b": "Junger Mann, du bist doch nicht etwa zum Ort {location} gegangen, oder? Es handelt sich um eine nur eingeschränkt zugängliche Gegend und es ist immer noch gefährlich dort. Du vergisst deine Sachen besser, die du dort gelassen hast.",
    "5c1a52c686f77431740a3839": "Obwohl du deine Ausrüstung am Ort {location} verloren hast, habe Ich meine Jungs losgeschickt, um sie zu suchen. Allerdings sind sie bisher noch nicht wieder zurückgekommen und ich habe den Kontakt zu ihnen verloren.",
    "5c1a533f86f77438bd2bfc6d": "Alles was im Gebiet der TerraGroup verloren geht, kannst du abhaken, es ist für immer weg. Aber ich bin froh dich gesund und munter zu sehen.",
    "5c5d950686f7747a777ade0c": "Have you got it all? Good, mercenary. Your hard-earned reward awaits you in the specified drop-spot, just as promised. Congratulations, and welcome.",
    "5c5d950686f7747a777ade0f": "Hello, mercenary. I have been watching you for quite a while now, and I know that you are able to solve the tasks assigned to you. Don't get too cocky now, you're not the only one who knows how to follow orders. There are more fighters like you, even more competent. I want to offer you a job, to give you a chance to become a part of something bigger than you can imagine. If you are ready, then here's an assignment for you: my people operate all over Tarkov and often leave souvenirs after themselves. The mission is to obtain and deliver those items to me. No questions asked. The things are extremely rare. I hope I don't have to remind you that you have to obtain all these items by yourself? Believe me, I like no other know when people lie. You will be informed of the drop spot. And one more thing, all my partners have already mastered their skills a long time ago and proven themselves reliable, and if you want to be one of them, then prove to me that you are not inferior to them in training. Don't try to contact me, I will do it myself when the time comes.",
    "5d25af0f86f77443e55d1457": "Hello there, come in, take a sit. The path of ours is not easy, not easy at all. Fighting scum is dangerous and requires extraordinary skills. For example, being fast, quiet, agile and deadly. Flanking the enemy, outplaying them on their own field. Your buddies chained in their body armor will never be able to master these skills. Therefore, before embarking on serious tasks, hone this skill.",
    "5d27080886f77469ef0f8955": "Learned the lesson? Good. See, you can disarm an enemy in many ways.",
    "5d27080886f77469ef0f8958": "Come on in. As a hunter, I can tell you for sure that holding control over the target is really important. Sometimes if you manage to blind the animal, even the most dangerous one, it stops being dangerous to you. This works with humans as well. Who cares how pimped out their guns are if they're as blind as moles? I want you to show me if you're able to properly blind your enemy.",
    "5d270bbc86f77469f1599fe6": "Be well, soldier. Do you like shopping? I used to love it too, we had a shopping center here. It was nice to spend time there, but as everything collapsed, there was no time for entertainment anymore, the stores quickly got looted, and what didn’t get looted got taken over by all kinds of scum as their mainstays. I heard that there was that one person - a former athlete, he's already been racketing before the war, and now as he has felt more power than ever, he's killing everyone indiscriminately. People call him Killa, and his helmet... you won’t miss it. Get rid of him, everybody will say thank you. And take his helmet with you, just in case.",
    "5d270bbc86f77469f1599fe3": "Finally, he got what he deserved. I believe the day is near when there will be no such scum left in these parts. Thank you, kid.",
    "5d2496bd86f77425cc4e9475": "Hast du es? Gute Arbeit. Also, ich glaube, du bist würdig mit Jäger in Kontakt zu treten. Er müsste einiges an Arbeit für dich haben.",
    "5d2496bd86f77425cc4e9478": "Mercenary, come here, I've been waiting for you. Just a couple of hours ago, my old friend Jaeger got in touch with me and informed me that he had quite useful information for me. The package with the information I need is encrypted and is located in the Priozersk Natural Reserve area. Where exactly - Jaeger did not specify, but he left a clue: “Look where the hunter would wait for his prey. Where the iron bird has fallen”. Bring me this package and I'll introduce you to Jaeger, he'll definitely have work for you.",
    "5d24b83286f7743d2612b6f8": "Thank you. Food in our time is a hard-to-get supply, it's hard to survive without it. Okay, we can talk about business then, when you have time. Come visit me from time to time, kid.",
    "5d24b83286f7743d2612b6fb": "Well hello there! I’ve been watching you for a long time - I’ve heard about your good and bad deeds. In our difficult time it is hard to remain the same person as you were before - you have to choose the side. So here I am on the side of those who clean our land from various scum, the ones who drag us further into the dark abyss. If you would like to join, I will be glad of any help. Mechanic let me know about your track record, says one can rely on you. Given the circumstances I have no more will power to stay away from what is happening around us. At first, I thought that it would be best to sit out in the wilderness in my reserve. But after what the local bandits started doing, after all these murders and robberies, after what they did to our city... In short, I will definitely need your services. And first of all, I need you to get me some supplies. The hermit's lifestyle really depleted my provisions.",
    "5d25a9e486f77443e3514eba": "Сам видишь времена пошли жёсткие помощи ждать неоткуда, а что нас не убивает делает сильнее.",
    "5d25af0f86f77443e55d1454": "As one famous person used to say \"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\". A piece of good advice, you better remember it. So, do you feel how easy it is to move without all those plates on you? If you move fast, you don't even need body armor to deal with scum.",
    "5d25b6ce86f77443ff46b9eb": "You did it? Thank you. I just got ready for the trip, so you're just in time. See you in a couple of days, fella.",
    "5d25b6ce86f77443ff46b9ee": "Hello there! You came right in time, I'm just packing up to go hunting. Do me a favor, not for service, but as a sign of friendship. Arrange a couple of rest spots for my way back: the trip is long, so I'll have to stop for a breather somewhere. The places should be safe, leave a Russian MRE and a bottle of water for each, agreed? At the same time, remember how to survive if you get caught with your pants down. I've got some stashes hidden here and there, for example, but you don't need to know about them yet.",
    "5d25c3e886f77444001e2840": "No way you can survive for so long! Impressive. Here you go, drink this, regain your strength.",
    "5d25c3e886f77444001e2843": "Hello there, warrior! My hunt went as planned. You know, the water you prepared for me did really come in handy. By the way, how good are you at handling dehydration? Show me how long PMCs can stay without water.",
    "5d25c85586f77408251c4225": "Handled it? Nicely done. Your training is almost done, friend. If we keep it that way, we may start taking care of the order in the city earlier than planned.",
    "5d25c85586f77408251c4228": "Hello there. Has it ever happened to you that you got into trouble, but there is no time to take care of the wound as you have to save your skin? Self-control in the most difficult situations is the key to survival. This is a very important skill in these difficult days for our city. Show me how well you handle pain.",
    "5d25cf5d86f77408251c422a": "Successful? Great! Sweat saves the blood! Don't get too ecstatic now, there are some more tasks for you.",
    "5d25cf5d86f77408251c422b": "So you failed, huh? Well, will be a lesson for you. Try again, and remember your mistakes.",
    "5d25cf5d86f77408251c422d": "You know, in combat - as in hunting, there are only two behavior models. You are either a hunter or prey. And since you intend to become a real hunter, you must learn to track prey without exposing yourself.",
    "5d25d4cb86f77443e55d2f73": "So you can even handle tremors? Great! To be honest, I didn't think you would succeed, the task was very difficult.",
    "5d25d4cb86f77443e55d2f76": "Come here, I've got a test for you. You must always maintain your composure, in every situation. You lose control or panic - you die. And no matter what happened - whether you've caught a bullet or just got drunk. But even with shaky hands, you have to shoot sharp. Prove to me that you can do this.",
    "5d25dbd086f77443e625e380": "So you survived? Who would've thought.",
    "5d25dbd086f77443e625e383": "I tell you what. If your opponent is blind - there's nothing they can do against you. No matter what gear they have on them or how well they shoot. Only self-composure can help one get over such a situation. What about you, kid? Are you good at keeping your composure when blinded?",
    "5d25fd4c86f77409de05bba6": "How many you say there were, six? And you got them all without the \"goggles\"? Indeed, you are a great night hunter, kid.",
    "5d25fd4c86f77409de05bba9": "As I've read in one article, the human eye can get used to the darkness. You know, I wanted to check, and I almost broke my leg in a deadfall. Guess I'm a little old for such a metamorphosis. But you, I think, are in the prime of life. A well-trained night eyesight can help us very much in our difficult tasks. So take care of this. You're a tough guy, you can take a punch. But what if you can't see anything at night and suddenly get ambushed by some scum? Those things happen quite often, not everyone can take NVGs into their raids. So, show me how you see in the dark, without any gadgets.",
    "5d26042386f77443ff46d19a": "How do people say? What is difficult in training will become easy in a battle! This skill will come in handy, trust me on this one. Your training is almost complete. Looks like you are ready to become the Hunter.",
    "5d26042386f77443ff46d19d": "I just can't count how much shit have I seen while working as a gamekeeper, friend. So many different people used to get lost in these woods. Some of them made it out alive and well, some of them didn't. You have to be one hell of a tough asshole to get out of the woods alive. Let's make a real survivalist out of you. Come to me when you're ready.",
    "5d260f8686f77469f04444b2": "Good job! Of course, there is enough scum in Tarkov, others will come for sure. But at least they will think twice before tearing the place apart.",
    "5d260f8686f77469f04444b5": "Well, fighter, it's time to start cleaning Tarkov from all this trash. You and I have come a long way and you still have a lot to learn. Well then, let's start with the area of ​​the chemical plant? A lot of useful things were being produced there, I had been working there for half a year as the security chief until the TerraGroup arrived. Since then, weird shit started happening there, I'm telling you, they gave up on producing cleaners and went on for something different, something dark. And as the lawlessness began and they left, the marauders began tearing the factory apart. It's sad to see it like this, I still remember every nook and cranny there. Long story short, it’s wrong. So go teach the bandits a lesson. If something useful still remains there, it would definitely be in the office area, you won’t miss it. Make the looters forget the way there, at least for a while.",
    "5d26f9f086f77469ee70ac2c": "You've done a good deed. One less bastard walking on this land. Take this, a gift from me and Mechanic.",
    "5d26f9f086f77469ee70ac2f": "Oh, it's you? I have something special for you today, a new hunt. There is this bastard, folks call him Reshala. You've definitely heard of him. He's got that golden pistol, one of a kind. This moron with the gang of his has been there for a while - robbing and killing people. He himself is just a coward, always hiding behind his guards. Help people get rid of him, the whole Tarkov will breathe easier. And take his pistol, It will be a good gift for Mechanic and his collection. But be extremely careful, many good fighters have already been killed by his gang. Good luck, hunter.",
    "5d27018e86f77469ef0f8950": "They made their choice when they stepped on the wrong path. You have done the right thing, hunter, thank you.",
    "5d27018e86f77469ef0f8953": "Greetings. For years I've been hunting in these woods, and among other things, I've learned that animals are way more humane than humankind itself. When the conflict started, all that's left of those remains of humane in people just vanished entirely. There are so many monsters out there that I can't even imagine. Those are no longer people, nor they are animals, they are something way worse... We can't let them destroy our city, we have to sort this out. Deal with this, hunter.",
    "5d27245186f774483c7bdb13": "So you made Shturman finally leave the sawmill. Well, not bad, many people can breathe in peace now. I might even move closer to the city myself, closer to home. Here's the reward, found some strange stashes in the woods, and that's what was in them. I don't need them, but you might find them useful.",
    "5d27245186f774483c7bdb16": "For many years working as a gamekeeper, I know that if there is an infection in the forest, then you need to get rid of it immediately before the whole forest gets infected. One such infection settled here, they call it Shturman, he and his crew set up at the sawmill, so now I don't feel safe even in my own reserve. Deal with it, it will be for the better for the forest and the people. But be careful, kid, Shturman has friends, and they all can shoot well.",
    "5d272b9086f774070261ec1d": "Protected the honor of the uniform? That's great. Screw them, there is nothing worse than giving the oath and then falling into crime.",
    "5d272b9086f774070261ec20": "Ah, it's you? Glad to see you, friend. Ever tracked your prey on a hunt? When all this fuss started here in Tarkov, lots of things changed, brothers started fighting one another - it’s the usual thing now. And the same works for the authorities, those who had to protect the law before became unscrupulous creatures, some haven't even changed from uniform, can you imagine? I have a personal score with them. Well, if you send some Scavs to hell, it will be for the better, there has been nothing human left in these men for a long time anyway. Get rid of the remains of Reshala's gang, they're dressed in police uniform, can't miss them.",
    "5d27323c86f77445722f1f98": "I've heard what you did. Looks like it's calmer out there now, with way fewer looters. You have my gratitude.",
    "5d27323c86f77445722f1f9b": "Good afternoon. I have a task for you. Before all this, customs and factory personnel lived in the dormitories on Customs, but now there are only looters. The Scavs are one thing, these fools have their brains completely beaten off, but your mercenary colleagues often go there too, and this is not good at all. They just rob the place, I hate those damn looters! Whatever times are, you must always remain human. Clear the dorms area, let the place breathe in peace again.",
    "5d27366b86f77445710a8072": "Welcome back, hunter. So you've dealt with the bandits? Can't even imagine how much of a hassle that was, you did a great job.",
    "5d27366b86f77445710a8075": "Come on in, sit down, there is a special task for you. Do you know the military base south of customs? One character set up there, a former marine. Even before the trouble in Tarkov occurred, he found himself interested in the crime business. They got everything under control back then: the security, customs services, everything. Then most of the gang fled, but not him... He gathered the most loyal of his men, also former soldiers, and they dug in somewhere at the base. He fumbles with warehouse reserves and sells them abroad, that bastard. Doesn't like uninvited guests either. He must be stopped, but this one will not be an easy walk. His fighters are well-trained, so think with your head how to deal with them.",
    "5d2739d386f77445710a8077": "So they're operating near laboratories and military facilities... Oh, I hope it won't start another war, on top of the one already going on. Well, kid, it's not for us to resolve this, at least for now.",
    "5d2739d386f77445710a807a": "The most shitty situations usually quickly make it clear on who is who. Some people stay the same, some people don't. And recently I've heard the rumors about the new forces in the area. They come out of nowhere, tear places apart, take whatever they want and vanish as if they never were there. They call themselves Raiders. People say that they are mostly ex-military and ex-PMCs, they are gathering into gangs and \"protect\" big facilities. I've also heard that they have someone really powerful behind them, pulling the strings from abroad. Calm down those bandits.",
    "5d27429986f774457527c7eb": "Got it? Great. Hopefully, I won't have to watch people die helplessly anymore.",
    "5d27429986f774457527c7ee": "Greetings. Here's the deal: I live in the wilderness, and sometimes I find badly wounded people, and I just have no means to help them. Some folks passed away right on my hands. I don't want that to happen again. Perhaps, if I have had a defibrillator I could've saved them. Bring me some. I know, it's a hard piece to find, but I think some places still have them. Oh, and grab some CMS kits, while you're at it.",
    "5d2747db86f7741d0b1f40ac": "Got it? Good, let's see what he's up to. Come back in a bit, Mechanic and I will check the flash drives, then we'll let you know too.",
    "5d2747db86f7741d0b1f40af": "Hey, come here for a minute. There is this shady guy in Tarkov. Folks call him Skier, a really slippery person, I’m sure he doesn’t disdain the crime either. I need to watch him. They say he's looking for some flash drives. I have no idea what's on them. Knowing his type I bet there's something rakish going on. I’d like to know it for sure. I don’t know what kind of flash drives he is looking for exactly, just bring me several of any you can find, and then we'll figure it out. Just make sure you get them yourself, we can't let those traders trick us. Mechanic will help us uncover what's on them.",
    "5d274eae86f77475a86565c1": "There's no way you actually found it! Thank you so much! Wait. Here, take this. A few days ago I've picked up a badly wounded USEC in the forest. I bandaged him up, but the poor fella didn't make it. Before dying, he gave me a key, looks like it is from one of his stashes somewhere in the Health Resort area. I don't need it, but you might find it useful.",
    "5d274eae86f77475a86565c4": "Hello there, come in. You know, at times, sitting by the campfire, I look back on how it all began. That time I've been on vacation in the health resort, it was in the evening, I remember that as if it was yesterday. I have just returned to the room after dinner, sat by the window to gaze at the bay. It looked marvelous. And then I hear trucks, not just a single one, a whole convoy. It was your colleagues, the USECs. They kicked everyone out of the resort, didn’t even let people pack their belongings. I don't care about my clothes as much as my photo album which remained there. Not as a service but as an act of friendship, please try to find it there. It is painfully dear to me as a memory of those calm days. My room was on the top floor of the health resort, in the west wing. The reward will be bountiful.",
    "5d2f378786f774169b7e0066": "You got them? Good work, kid. Now we just have to figure out how to find this laboratory. Well, I'll deal with this matter myself, don't worry.",
    "5d2f378786f774169b7e0069": "Well hello there, warrior! How are you? Doing good? Listen, I've got an unusual task to do, Mechanic asked me to make one special thing for his home, and this \"thing\" is such a complicated one that it requires some advanced electronics. And there's no place in the city where these things could be found, damn it. However, there are rumors that somewhere around here is the TerraGroup laboratory. It might have the details we need. The Laboratory is too dangerous to send you there alone, but at least bring me the access cards. Will you help? And yes, the cards should be new, not the ones you could just buy from those shady traders.",
    "5d3076e386f7743c836efc88": "So you say only the chairman's house is still intact, but you didn't see him himself? No? Oh, Stepan...",
    "5d3076e386f7743c836efc8b": "Come in, I want to ask you for something. You know the health resort area, right? At first, the factory workers were convalescing there, and then the TerraGroup employees settled there their staff. I’ve been to those parts a long time ago, my classmates lived there. So, I want you to check on them, it's the old village with the church. The priest, his name is Pyotr. Misha, the fisherman. And Stepan, the local chairman. Check their houses, find out if any of them are still there.",
    "5d4bec6a86f7741e530d2c02": "Now that's the good stuff! Heavy as hell, yeah? So anyway, I keep my word about the reward, check out the new rifles I have...",
    "5d4bec6a86f7741e530d2c05": "Come on in, warrior! Still breathing aye? Good to hear. Here's a task for you. There's this customer, showed up outta nowhere with an urgent order and the bitch wants specific equipment, the one our glorious mother Russia produced, and my heart aches that the good of the state has to be sold to whoever. Judging by the accent, the fucker is from abroad. But the cash is noble and the connections he provides are no joke. Anyway, you need one military battery, the heavy one, and several OFZ shells. I feel you'll have to sneak on the military base for it... The place is inhospitable, I know, but you won't regret it when the checkout time comes. Plus, I’ll provide you with a special gift for this. Will you take the risk?",
    "5d66914986f7743690020694": "Look who we've got here! Hello there! Listen, you know about the military base close to the health resort? Porbably were there yourself. So, I've got some news. They say the old warehouses there still have a lot of food left in them, and that bandit groups began roaming there, not your regular Scavs, they are well-equipped. I want you to check out if there's anything left in those warehouses. But be careful, there really are a lot of dangerous people there.",
    "5d66912c86f774368f43a242": "Those are damn great rifles! Good work! You know, I think I might get into gunsmithing myself, I took quite a liking to this thing. So, about the reward: check out the little things I found, you might need them.",
    "5d66912c86f774368f43a245": "Come on in. Want some tea? Well, whatever. So listen, here's the deal. Soon I will be hosting a few friends of mine. I want to go hunting with them, but there's just no way I can take them hunting with these MP shotguns, right? I have a couple of nice western rifles here, but I need them to be zeroed properly first. And we have just the client for that, his name is Shturman. So, test my build (Remington M700 sniper rifle with a March Tactical 3-24x42 FFP scope) on this scum. The scope is of very high magnification, can even count moles on people's faces, so you better find a long-range position. Don't worry, I won't disappoint you with the reward, kid.",
    "5d66914986f7743690020691": "Have they already started to take everything out? Got it, we have to act fast.",
    "5d6fb45f86f77449d825f9cc": "So, have you decided? Just a couple of injections. Here and here. Keep yourself calm, at least a couple of days, relax more and take your vitamins.",
    "5d6fb45f86f77449d825f9cf": "Oh, it's you? Concerned about your health? Well, this is commendable. I have several very effective imported vaccinations, but you understand what situation we are all in, it was not easy to get them, and therefore they cost a lot. But it is up to you to decide what is more important to you, money or health...",
    "5d6fbedb86f77449d825f9d4": "So, I've been told you took up the training. Well, with your skills, I'm sure you'll learn quick.",
    "5d6fbedb86f77449d825f9d7": "How's life treating you, mercenary? Maybe you will be interested, a friend of mine is exceptionally skilled at shooting sniper rifles. He worked as a PMC, but now he has retired and is mentoring people for cash. But I'm afraid that his services are not cheap. If you decide, I think I could arrange a meeting for you.",
    "5da89be186f7742f9026cb8b": "Verdammt gute Arbeit ohne Blutverlust heraus zu kommen. Hier, nimm diesen Aufbau und meinen Respekt.",
    "5da89bb186f77414b61f8a43": "Ich habe gehört, dass du einem meiner Männer geholfen hast zu überleben. Nobler Zug! Hier, sieh das als Zeichen meiner Dankbarkeit und meines Respekts an.",
    "5db82b8e8bf4c142f615e0d8": "Das Paket wurde erweitert!\nVielen Dank für die Unterstützung unseres Projekts, wir haben dir die zusätzliche Ausrüstung zugeschickt!",
    "5dc5401c86f77469c5053043": "Got it done already? Nice job. Wait here a minute, I need to measure your sizes and figure out the sewing technique for this one. As promised. But hey, you gotta understand that the materials ain't cheap these days, so be prepared for the price. Still, it's got three stripes, an icon of style, you know.",
    "5dc5401c86f77469c5053046": "So there's this dandy asshole in Ultra mall. Lurking around, cleaning the supplies, gunning everyone down right on spot. Folks out there are hella scared of him. I tell you what, you punish him properly, and I will get you a nice stylish jacket just like his one so you could give it a proper use. Could cosplay as him and shit. Just be careful, the dude is hella dangerous.",
    "5e0653d486f774478e6132f3": "Nun, Soldat, immer noch auf der Suche nach neuen Erfahrungen? Ich bewundere deine Einstellung. Hier ist eine kleine Belohnung für dich!",
    "5e4c013a86f774264f7582f0": "You got it? Nice. Come back soon, I'll tell you what else I need. There will be something special for you. In the meantime, go on and try on the new clothes.",
    "5e4c013a86f774264f7582f3": "Oh, brother, come in. Wanna get something cool? I have some new clothes in store for you, but it's rare and not cheap. Bring me these things, and make sure they're pristine, no traders. My supplies are completely out and I'm overwhelmed with orders. You can check Ultra, they used to sell those materials there back in the day, but the looters probably took it all over Tarkov. Let me make a list for you, I need a lot of stuff.",
    "5e4c01bb86f774264f7582fe": "You got it? Good work. Come back a bit later, I will have another task for you. You can try on the new clothes, by the way.",
    "5e4c01bb86f774264f758301": "Come on in, no need to stand in the doorway. I have a job for you. I'm all busy with orders, and I'm almost out of materials. Can you find me some? I'll be able to offer you something new in return. It won't be cheap though. Made in.. well, you know where. And yeah, make sure that those materials are pristine, get them yourself, without traders' help. Anyway, bring them in as soon as you get them. Find them wherever you want, but I think there was a big supply of them in the Ultra mall. Lemme make a list for you.",
    "5e4d4dd086f77438b1632d88": "That's exactly what I need! Put it all over there. Lemme measure you... Well, it's gonna be a tough one. Don't worry, you'll love the result, bro.",
    "5e4d4dd086f77438b1632d8b": "So, here's another list of the stuff I need. As soon as you have it - bring it here, and make sure it's in good condition. No traders and all, well, you know the deal. I'm thinking about some new outfits for you, something recognizable, warming the Russian heart. I have no idea what's the business between you and the yanks, but these days your life is as shitty as theirs. Shit happens. Anyway, good luck to you.",
    "5e4d533b86f774264f758340": "C'mon, so you have everything? Leave 'em somewhere in the corner and come here, I need to measure you. This stuff is quite a rarity in our current conditions, so don't get mad about the price. But at least the American spirit won't abandon you, he-he.",
    "5e4d533b86f774264f758343": "Come on in, I was just thinking about you. Alright, so listen, I need more of these items listed here, and they have to be brand new, no traders. Come on, don't make faces too early! I'll get you some cool news clothes for this, the Kansas spirit and all or whatever. Just imagine that, running and gunning here in a foreign country in clothes like from the ranch! Well anyway, I'm waiting for the listed items, the reward is generous.",
    "5e74a56e86f774574226168f": "Danksagungs-Paket.",
    "5e8b161d3df5342bf72985ea": "#wirbleibenzuhause",
    "5eaab0193cf86b0e62795663": "So I see you've made it. How's your head? Dizzy? Feeling like you're going to throw up? That's the side effects of those drugs, you have to pay the price to stay alive, even pay with your health. But anyway, listen here, I have some tips on how to reduce those side effects, so next time you would feel a little better.",
    "5eaab0193cf86b0e62795666": "Times are harsh these days, you know it well. You have to survive by all means, even if those means are not the safest for your health. For example, those stimulants, folks started seeing them more frequently in the region. In reality, it's a narcotic of some sort, I feel that TerraGroup is involved here for sure. But anyway, want it or not, but you will have to learn how to use them in combat, these drugs do not only kill, but sometimes help you survive.",
    "5eda1a252c86b5153955be37": "So you're saying there's quite a lot of supplies? Guess he found himself a fresh unopened medical warehouse and is now selling everything out from it. If only I could find that warehouse... well, that's not your problem anyway. For now.",
    "5eda1a252c86b5153955be3a": "Oh, you're just in time. Maybe you have already heard that a new doctor has shown up? But this one is not some good-willed Aesculapius - he helps some people but cripples others. They say he sells medicine and does surgeries right on the street. They call him Sanitar, can you imagine? He settled on the Shoreline and interestingly enough, the local punks are very happy with him, and it's clear why: he patches them up, and even sells them drugs and first-aid kits of all sorts. This means that he has quite an inventory with him. Find out about this Sanitar, but quietly. For now, just find out where this scum hangs out. I think that he does both the selling and healing at the same spots. You interested?",
    "5edab4e4218d181e29451436": "You did the right thing. Even if others say that Sanitar did good deeds, he brought much more evil. Don't believe those people's lies. I've seen people like Sanitar before: once they go crazy, there's no turning back. You can only shoot them like rabid dogs.",
    "5edab4e4218d181e29451437": "So you believed that woman? You do realise that she's just deceiving you for her own benefit? Do you think that because Sanitar treats some people, he can't kill others? You've completely gone insane with that war or yours, can't distinguish black from white. Get out of my sight, I want to be alone.",
    "5edab4e4218d181e29451439": "Hey there, kid. Something nostalgic came over me. I remembered how I walked along the coast, it was beautiful there, the waves roll in, the sun, the beach, and the sunsets there were outstanding, and now what? The smell of rot and desolation everywhere, can't even breathe properly in the city... And on top of all that, a new moron showed up. They call him Sanitar. This scum conducts experiments on people and perhaps does even more terrible things. You can't leave it like this, such people.. such abominations should not walk our ground. The world will only become cleaner. Deal with this.",
    "5edab779bcf60e4a143cb298": "All three groups wiped out? I don't understand how this could happen. They were not supposed to attract attention and get involved in a fight. They were negotiators with a very lucrative trade offer. Looks like the negotiations went horribly wrong.",
    "5edab779bcf60e4a143cb29b": "Good afternoon. It is obvious that in the current difficult situation, everyone who has medical knowledge is worth gold, not to mention actual working doctors. And it looks like such a doctor has appeared. I was told that someone on the Shoreline is treating the locals and selling them medicine. I have hired several groups to go there. They had to find this doctor, enter into negotiations and offer the best terms. But today, none of the groups got in touch. We need these medications, I've got clients... ahem, people in need to worry about. Find my people and find out what happened.",
    "5edaba9ed143ed1d6378d126": "Did you bring the tools? Put them in that box, I will need to clean them properly, it is unclear where they have been before. You can clearly see he is in a difficult situation, everything is covered in blood, clearly unsanitary conditions. Well, that's my business now. I'll give Sanitar his tools back along with the letter through the one local we bribed so that he understands what we want from him.",
    "5edaba9ed143ed1d6378d129": "The loss of my people on the Shoreline is certainly a very unpleasant event, but a new source of medicine is more important. We just need a different approach to this case. My assistant managed to bribe a local from the Shoreline to tell us about Sanitar, the medic we're looking for. He has a small security detail, a few spots on the shoreline, but what's strange is that he performs surgery right on the street, and often hides his tools near such places, in buildings nearby. Get me these tools. Sanitar will be more cooperative if he realizes that we can stop his trade at any time and take control of the territory.",
    "5edabd33bcf60e4a143cb2a4": "Good stuff, good stuff! Finally, Prapor will get his caches exposed, there are probably whole mountains of loot. Guns, ammo, food, dope. Out fucking standing! We'll do this one ourselves though, without you. No offense. Thanks.",
    "5edabd33bcf60e4a143cb2a7": "Hey you, tough guy! C'mere, I have a job for you. I've heard Prapor sent you to get a supply of drugs from some Sanitar dude. Don't make that face! I ain't got no interest in those drugs, let Prapor collect it and put it up his ass, you have already received profit from him anyway, haven't you? You just need to put these smart little things in containers that are in Sanitar's stashes. Prapor won't get wind of anything, it's a two-minute job, but the profit is good. Just gotta do it fast, before they move those containers.",
    "5edac02b0880da21347b382f": "Gute Arbeit. Ich habe bereits ein paar durchaus interessante Angebote erhalten. Etwas sagt mir, dass die Meds irgendwas mit der TerraGroup zu tun haben.",
    "5edac02b0880da21347b3832": "Hello. Straight to the point. Yes. There is news about new stimulators. They make a person not feel any pain, give them strength. They are being sold somewhere on the shoreline, Sanitar, yes, that's the merchant's name. He sells medicine and stimulants to the local junkies... I mean residents. I need to get this medication. Developing new stimulants is expensive, especially difficult with testing on humans. But here, we can say that testing is already in progress and gives results. Many of my acquaintances will be interested in such results. Please bring me samples of these drugs. Make sure that they are sealed and untouched.",
    "5edac362930f5454f51dcacc": "Thank you. I knew you would understand how important Sanitar and his... medication are right now. He has already shown a great interest in keycards and stimulants and sent the first batch of goods. Here, this is your share.",
    "5edac362930f5454f51dcacd": "It is a pity that you listened to this Jaeger instead of the voice of reason. Sanitar with his knowledge and medicines could've helped us in many ways. He wasn't a saint, but surely everyone has a chance to atone for their sins, but you have took away that chance. I am very displeased with you.",
    "5edac362930f5454f51dcacf": "Young man, wait. I knew that Jaeger would ask you to kill Sanitar, but you don't have to do it. I understand Jaeger's point of view, that he's just some kind of monster in the flesh, but he is not. I'm sure Sanitar is just trying to help the locals. Given the current circumstances, he performs the most complex surgeries and it is not surprising that they often end badly. He is a doctor with the most valuable knowledge that can save many more lives. A doctor with access to a warehouse of medicines that are extremely important to us. And he has already entered into negotiations with me and will soon begin to cooperate. But for this, I need something that will interest him and I think I know what will: the Laboratory. Access keys and samples of military stimulants, I think they are the basis on which he conducts his experiments. Can you find them for me? You can get the access keycards however you want, but the stimulants must be sealed, so you need to find them yourself.",
    "5edac64ba0055865214cb5b8": "We have decoded that flash drive. There's a lot of important information there, but I can't tell you everything. It's classified. I can tell you about Sanitar though, he's a scientist. He studied and developed drugs, and then tested them on people. Very... bold, or, as they sometimes say, unethical research.",
    "5edac64ba0055865214cb5bb": "Good day to you, mercenary. Because the day is actually good. I was right, the new stimulants are connected to TerraGroup. Mechanic found information about Sanitar. Not too much, and it was very expensive for us, but it's better than nothing. Sanitar worked for TerraGroup, and not as an ordinary employee. Graduated in medicine, specialist in infectious diseases, divorced... Well, that's all the information we have on him. Give me more, my friend, I'm very interested in where he got access to such resources. Find his workplace and find out more.",
    "5ede5521fa6dc072ce15d6dc": "So you say it's a command shelter? Rumors don't lie, huh... God damn! I'll send my men there today, let them check the place out. There could be so much valuable shit there! Anyway, here, take your reward. As promised.",
    "5ede5521fa6dc072ce15d6df": "Greetings, warrior. So here's the deal, a birdy told me that those ex-army guys who secured Reserve base dug out some pass to the underground bunker. Of course, they didn't do it with their own hands, they forced the Scavs to do the job, and most likely none of the poor bastards made it back out. So anyway, I've got no idea what sort of bunker that is. I've had some information that it could be the command bunker. But I'm not sure if it's exactly that bunker or just a bomb shelter for the base personnel. For now, there's no use to send a big group there for them to just die to those raiders. Check those catacombs out and let me know if it's worth sending a group there. The pay is good. You in?",
    "5ede569dfe4acc383071864b": "Welcome back, I'm listening. Aha, so that's how it is... The door is right there, right? Just draw it right on top of my map, don't worry. So this bunker connects almost all facilities of the base? Fuck, how convenient, you could travel half the base under everyone's nose. Now it's clear why the raiders are there, you can control the entire base from under there. Thank you, warrior! Here's your reward.",
    "5ede569dfe4acc383071864e": "Hey, merc, you are just in time, you are exactly who I need. Do you remember that fucking command bunker you found under the Reserve base? Long story short, my guys went there, and it turned out to be a real nasty place. Built with a high level of protection: filters, generators, all entrances are blocked by extremely strong hermetic locks, it's like an underground fortress. But the raiders opened the fucking thing and dug in like Alabama ticks. So, my men got in serious trouble, less than half made it out of there. But you know, now it's even more intriguing, for fuck's sake. So my people will not go there anymore for no reason, but if you could find a safe route for them... You are an experienced guy, so I need you to quietly, on those soft paws of yours, find out where all the entrances are. The guys said the entrances had those big hermetic doors. So it's up to you to scout the way in.",
    "5ee5e6ba233a4f161e46b493": "Nun, Soldat, da hast du etwas Neues gelernt, huh? Diese Erfahrung wird dir im Kampf helfen, da bin ich mir sicher. Vertrau einem alten Soldaten. Du hast mich glücklich gemacht, du hast mich an meine alten Tage erinnert. Hier, nimm dieses kleine Geschenk.",
    "5ee5e6d812a2b34a4350bd53": "Bist du auch immer wachsam? Ja, du wirst die Fehler von anderen anderen nicht wiederholen. Ich stimme zu, nimm das, es wird nützlich sein.",
    "5ee5e7128a8d84455531b614": "Wie ich sehe, verlierst du keine Zeit. Wissen, Bruder, ist nicht nur für Wissenschaftler wichtig, sondern auch für Soldaten. Es ist das, was diejenigen ausmacht, welche echte Profis werden. Nimm das, es könnte nützlich sein.",
    "5f08e8d3ec85fa71e9393f62": "So that's how it is, it's right on the first floor? How many times have my people been there and found nothing. Did you get inside the room? Found anything interesting in there? Well, doesn't matter, I'll send my boys to check it out anyway. Here's your reward, you've earned it. Thank you.",
    "5f08e8d3ec85fa71e9393f65": "Hey, come on in. Have you heard about some new guy that appeared in the resort area? Calls himself Sanitar. Not a simple man either, definitely worked for TerraGroup when they settled in the health resort. Either a major scientist there or just close to guys who were, no info on that. I've heard he's selling some secret stimulants, this means he understands chemistry quite well. But long story short, he's got some sort of an office or stash in the health resort, and I want you to find that place. I'll send specialists, maybe they'll find some interesting devices there. Just be careful, this man is dangerous.",
    "5fd4c93f99cf630ebf4fabdf": "Hast du schon herausgefunden was was ist? Ist das Zeug, halt die Augen offen wenn du Raiden gehst. Wenn du handeln möchtest, komm zu mir.",
    "5fdb3e50148b192e1a7463e5": "Greetings, warrior. I have a job for you. Long story short, I lost contact with one of my groups, and it's been quite a while ago. When shit hit the fan, I sent them to Woods to pick up some cargo. I'm afraid they got ambushed, the last time I got through, they reported that the USECs were closing in on them from the hills. Investigate it, check if anyone survived. Their convoy had a BRDM, a Bukhanka van, and a truck of some sort, I do not remember what kind exactly. I think that the USECs must have settled somewhere near there too, so stay sharp. Find my convoy and those USECs' camp, if it is really there. Dismissed.",
    "5fdb3e50148b192e1a7463e2": "So my guys didn't make it and the transports were looted... Plus a USEC camp nearby, you say? That sucks, the cargo was very important. Well, you've done your part of the deal, so here's the reward. You can buzz off now.",
    "5fd4c9229e4b2a58b34bbd2b": "Du hast wohl deine Leute verloren, wenn du nicht aufpasst fängst du dir eine Kugel. Ich geb dir ein wenig Vorsprung. Du bist ein netter Zeitgenosse und wir werden gut zurecht kommen wenn du dich daran gewöhnt hast. Ich bin immer auf der Suche nach Leute für meine Missionen. Achja, man nennt mich Prapor, nett dich kennen zu lernen. ",
    "600303b71448362c785bc3b2": "The air in the whole Woods trembled from such furious firefight. The scum got what he deserved, and all thanks to you. Here, the appropriate reward for such a feat. Don't be shy, you can buy the new rifles too.",
    "600303b71448362c785bc3b5": "Hey there, kid! Come on in. I've got a job for you, an important one. Remember when I asked you to rid the sawmill of scum? Well, it seems that they returned for good now. Shturman and his friends are once again bringing fear into people all around the area, however, I can't deal with them myself. Please, help me get rid of those bandits, and I won't disappoint with the reward. Mechanic introduced me to a new supplier, they're selling me some good and powerful western rifles, the .338 caliber ones. If you help me, you can get some of those for yourself, for shooting elephants, you know. A proper weapon for a good hunt! Well, boy, I'll be waiting for news from you.",
    "609a2c2c0ce4cd3a353dfc6e": "Hey there, fighter. There's a new task, but you'll have to go to the same place you whacked those Raiders on the state reserve base. Your previous efforts weren't fruitful enough, apparently: the Raiders dug in deep in that bunker, not letting anyone near it. However, I still do have quite an interest in that place. There's a piece of information from trusted sources that there are some classified documents there in the offices. The info is encrypted, so Raiders don't really care about it. Find me those documents, I've got serious clients for them.",
    "60ed4eb726b88043510e0af8": "Hello, mercenary, can you help me out with something? I have a client here, they need me to deliver a couple of items to two specific drop spots on Customs. Are you down? The client needs two REAP-IR scopes: the first one has to be stashed under the yellow crane on the construction site, it's near a big fortified building, and the second one has to be stashed behind the garbage containers at the gas station, the one on the main road. The only issue is that the scopes are very rare and I don't have those on me right now.",
    "6086e212949eb1096c45400d": "Well done, mercenary! We have received the transmitted beacon signals. Good work, here is your reward. I will contact you later.",
    "6086e212949eb1096c454010": "Good day. As you know, the blue helmets are here to lower the level of aggression in the region. That is why I want you to assess the danger levels. Infiltrate the military base and search it for anything that could present military danger. After all, the blue helmets are supposed to keep the peace. Some knowledgeable people have provided me with a list of military machinery located in the military base area, which also includes NATO units. I think they want to safely dispose of it, or something else, I don't know. Anyway, you have to find the machinery and mark it with beacons. The clients offer good money for this, so don't let me down, mercenary.",
    "609a2b52a370660c971129f1": "Ist ja gut! Nimm das Geld! Meine einzige Bedingung ist, dass du niemandem von diesem Deal erzählst.",
    "609a2b53a370660c971129f4": "Hi, my friend! One of my blue helmet colleagues made a deal with one of the state reserve signalmen before the big conflict, he wanted to borrow a certain device. I don't know much about this device, but it had something to do with the tank commander equipment. Then the conflict began, and the base was attacked. I think that the device is still inside the base, probably hidden somewhere in the command bunker. If you bring me this device and not ask any questions, I will generously pay you.",
    "609a2c2c0ce4cd3a353dfc6b": "Du hast sie? Gute Arbeit Soldat! Hier ist deine Belohnung, wie abgemacht.",
    "609a2c53eca522371e5725df": "Good work out there. I hope they get what's going on now and that they can't just kill my people like that. Here's the reward.",
    "609a2c53eca522371e5725e2": "Grüße Soldat. Ich habe hier einen neuen Auftrag für dich, bezüglich der Militärbasis. Du weißt schon, die du vor einiger Zeit für mich überprüft hast. Zusammenfassung: Ich bin nicht erfreut darüber, dass meine Leute in diesem Bunker umsonst gestorben sind. Das geht so nicht. Ich möchte diese Raider wissen lassen, dass ihre Taten Konsequenzen haben. Auge für Auge, du weißt schon. Kehre zu dem Bunker zurück und zeig jedem den du in der Nähe dieser Kommandobüros findest, wo der Hammer hängt. Die sollen merken, mit wem sie es zu tun haben und sie besser aufhören sollten.",
    "609a2c73311628516a014cf2": "Hast du sie finden können? Danke dir vielmals. Diese Dokumente werden natürlich nur für das Wohl der Menschheit eingesetzt, du kannst mir vertrauen.",
    "609a2c73311628516a014cf5": "Good afternoon, young man. I have been looking for someone like you just now. I have received information about a new vaccine against a rare strain of flu virus that was being tested at the Reserve base, officially... I cannot tell you what was actually tested there, but TerraGroup is somehow involved in this. The results of these tests could prove extremely valuable for humanity... and the group of my western clients. I need to find those tests, so you have to travel to the Reserve base and find the medical observation journals for patients. This documentation should be somewhere in the locked rooms of the headquarters medical unit. Will you take on this task? Of course, you will be rewarded for your work.",
    "609a2c96b89a3c264d729702": "So sieht es also aus! Gut. Danke dir, ich werde sie später eingehend studieren. Hier ist deine Bezahlung, wie versprochen.",
    "609a2c96b89a3c264d729705": "Hello. I've decided to get involved with military electronics, it's quite a promising business, and I've got interested people for that. And the army, as you know, has the most secure communication: digital encryptions, GPS, GLONASS and all kinds of other things. So anyway, I've got info about some device on Reserve, usually seen in workshops in the service and repair centers, I think it's used in machinery, it's some kind of control and navigation block. I want you to find this block and bring it to me. Would be interesting to see what it has inside of it. I'll reward you of course.",
    "609a2cf0a370660c971129f5": "So the exit works? Excellent. I'm still preparing your reward, so tell me more about the opening mechanism for that bunker door in the meantime.",
    "609a2cf0a370660c971129f8": "Hey, was hältst du von dieser komplexen Technologie? Ich zum Beispiel war schon immer fasziniert von diesem Zeug. Von den ganzen Abhängigkeiten untereinander und alles funktioniert sogar ohne menschliches Dazutun, naja fast zu mindest. Ich habe gehört, dass es irgendwo in der Militärbasis einen unterirdischen Ausgang geben soll, welcher von irgendwo anders aktiviert werden muss, aber von wo genau - keine Ahnung. Wie auch immer, es wäre klasse, wenn du dich dort umsehen könntest. Die Basis ist ein echtes Höllenloch wie du weißt und ich bin bereit großzügig für alle Informationen darüber wie man dort sicher rauskommt zu bezahlen. Ich möchte Leute hinschicken um militärische Ausrüstung zu holen, aber ich fürchte, dass sie einfach abgeknallt werden, wenn sie den geheimen Ausgang nicht finden.",
    "609a2d1734103b660e791a2c": "Sauber, meine Jungs sind gesund und munter wieder zurück, nicht ein Kratzer. Hier ist deine Belohnung!",
    "609a2d1734103b660e791a2f": "Oh, da bist du ja, genau richtig! Ich könnte deine Hilfe gebrauchen. Meine Leute versuchen ein paar Versorgungsgüter vom Lager in der Militärbasis auszuleihen, hatten aber bisher noch kein Glück. Die Jungs da meinen es echt ernst und sie sind verdammt hart drauf, nicht diese typischen Klugscheißer. Ich habe das Gefühl, dass solange du ihnen noch nicht den Arsch aufgerissen hast, können meine Leute dort nichts holen … Die Basis interessiert mich einen Scheiß, aber in den unterirdischen Lagern soll echt gutes Zeug sein. Du hilfst uns oder? Yeah, geh dort hin und unterstützt meine Leute während sie den Ort durchsuchen.",
    "609a2d471a63a207ed0bfaa6": "Da bist du ja, du hast die Orte also durchsucht? Es ist schon alles quasi leer sagst du? Das ist schade, aber naja, ändert nichts daran, dass du deine Aufgabe erfüllt hast.",
    "609a2d471a63a207ed0bfaa9": "Salam, brother! Come in! Got a task for you. The reserve base's got several soldier barracks, and usually, they're supposed to have an arsenal and a storage room in them. I wanna know if there's anything left there so I could gather a group for it, or if everything's already looted. Wanna stroll there and check it out? Need to search some specific places, I've even got a list of where there could still be unlooted stuff.",
    "609a2d673c1a3d23997897b8": "Vielen Dank. Jetzt wissen wir wo sie sind und müssen nichts riskieren. Hier ist deine Belohnung für wirklich gute Arbeit mein Freund.",
    "609a2d673c1a3d23997897bb": "Hey there! I'm gathering my guys to search the reserve base for fuel. They say there are stationary fuel tanks and tank cars, but I don't know where they are exactly, so I don't wanna send my guys to search for them while they're getting shot at by snipers and shit, so why not you go there yourself and quietly mark the fuel tanks with beacons? Look for the big groups of fuel cisterns.",
    "609a2d86eca522371e5725e3": "Erledigt? Die Luft riecht fast schon frischer. Es ist eine Schande, dass es keinen anderen Weg gab für sie.",
    "609a2d86eca522371e5725e6": "Come in, have a seat. You know how angry the local scum makes me, especially the damn looters, I can't stand them. Somebody steals from others to survive, but some do it for profit, and there are especially plenty of the latter ones in Tarkov. Take the military base, for example. I've been there before this whole conflict, it was such a beautiful sight: everything is clean, in order, the ground is almost glittering under the sun. And now the whole place is filled with all sorts of scum and marauders. I have a request for you: go there and let those looters know that you have to stay human in any situation.",
    "60c0c1fe4f865e03b906aa05": "Das sind gute Neuigkeiten. Die Welt ist jetzt ein bisschen sauberer. Hoffe, dass dich dieser Bastard nicht mit seinem Vorschlaghammer erwischt hat?",
    "60c0c1fe4f865e03b906aa08": "Good day to you. There's a special task for you today. A new individual dug in in the old chemical plant, the one TerraGroup used for their shady business, locals call this man Tagilla. Either breathed in some chemicals or got hit in the head - the fellow went completely off the rails. Murdering both his own people and the others. He uses a sledgehammer, and he's good with it, even a professional shooter would begrudge him. He's finished many people in that factory's corridors. Scavs respect him and don't get in his way. There's no place for such as him on this earth... You know what to do, hunter.",
    "60ed4dac63fe3506455d8f97": "Here you are, swift one. You pleased the old man, and drew conclusions yourself, I hope. You yourself are the weapon and the monolith, not the amount of steel you wear.",
    "60ed4dac63fe3506455d8f9a": "We've come a long way together, you've learned a lot. Now prove to me that it doesn't matter how much armor you wear, what's important is experience, agility, and intellect, the hunter spirit. How can an enemy harm you if they don't even see you? They'll be tricked by a more experienced warrior. When you realize this truth, you'll be harder than steel.",
    "60ed4df7ad25e3185465bbdd": "I've heard, I've heard. You did the right thing, kid. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.",
    "60ed4df7ad25e3185465bbde": "Couldn't handle it, I figure? Don't worry, I don't blame you, boy, it's not an easy task. So go on, recuperate and come back.",
    "60ed4df7ad25e3185465bbe0": "Come on in, kid. Got anything interesting to tell? Eh, forget it, don't want to listen about your war. Got enough of it here. I don't have much to teach you anymore, you know how to stand up for yourself, and you know of justice well. Met the local bandit leaders too. But have you tried getting them all at once? The task in not an easy one, but the goal is worth it. The most important thing is what mark we leave behind us.",
    "60ed4e2ca664b027ab1441c7": "Good stuff! Come on, brother, sit down, let's celebrate!",
    "60ed4e2ca664b027ab1441ca": "Welcome, brother! Say, how do you feel about booze? I've got an order for a large batch of alcohol, they need whiskey and vodka. Just imagine, there's war going around, but people still drink... Anyway, I need it to be fresh, so make sure you find only the good stuff. You've got golden hands, always find everything I need. So what do you think, can you find me some grog? We'll have a good drink to success after! Some vodka and whiskey would be great for a start. Oh, and get some water canisters too, for a hangover, you know.",
    "60ed4e5696463e702776938f": "Respect, brother, you helped me out big time! If you see any dangerous dudes in Ultra, you let me know. Might need you to deal with them again.",
    "60ed4e5696463e7027769392": "Salam, brother, help me out. I sent my guys to Ultra today to grab some clothes, but a big group of PMCs gave them a \"warm welcome\" - fucking shot at my guys and kicked them out of the mall. I'm running a damn business here, mind you! Need to make deliveries, people are waiting. Brother, please go and deal with those fuckers. I'll owe you big!",
    "60ed4eb726b88043510e0af5": "Great, thank you very much, friend. The client already reported that they got the packages. I don't think it's the last order from them, so I'll count on you further.",
    "60ed4ef3ad25e3185465bbe1": "Great, that's all the results I needed, hand me the notebook. Thanks, mercenary.",
    "60ed4ef3ad25e3185465bbe4": "Ah, hey there, come on in. Listen, I want to ask you for something. You've already got accustomed to shooting at long-range distances, right? I need to calibrate some weapons, the zeroing is extremely important for every gun. I want you to grab your favorite rifle and shoot at enemies from at least 100 meters away. The shots have to be lethal and the targets have to be seriously trained. Write down all your results into a notebook, I'll process the data after. I'll be waiting for the results.",
    "60ed4fc7d7b7cb55e94c178f": "Good, good. We highly appreciate all you have done for us, mercenary. See you later.",
    "60ed4fc7d7b7cb55e94c1792": "Greetings, mercenary. My contacts are in need of a large supply of military equipment. You could definitely help us in this matter. Will you find the required items for us? I will make a list of the needed equipment.",
    "60ed4fefa664b027ab1441cb": "Great, great! The clients have already rewa– uh, thanked us for the successful mission. Good job, mercenary.",
    "60ed4fefa664b027ab1441ce": "Mercenary, come here for a minute. I have an order of elimination of several groups of PMCs, the highly experienced ones. Sending my soldiers to this would be a suicide mission, so that is why I suggest you to handle this matter. What do you say? As proof of the work done, you have to bring me dogtags from both of those groups.",
    "60ed5052bc9a8b34cd453b93": "Marvelous, mercenary. Now it will be much easier for my people to operate on the location! Thank you for your work.",
    "60ed5052bc9a8b34cd453b96": "Ah, I have been waiting for your arrival, mercenary. I presume you already know about the group of ex-PMC scavengers that pillage the reserve base? My western partners, who are conducting an evacuation of the remaining valuable equipment, are very troubled by those former mercenaries. I think it is in our mutual interest to decrease those bandits' numbers. Do you get what I am getting at?",
    "60ed508696463e7027769393": "Brilliant, just remarkable. You have done a good deed for everyone in need.",
    "60ed508696463e7027769396": "Young man, are you busy at the moment? An interested party from abroad, from behind the barricades, took an interest in a big batch of valuable medical equipment. I think they will find a better use if, instead of the scum here, you understand me. I would be extremely grateful if you could find the required tools for me. Here, take this. This is the list containing all the needed tools.",
    "60ed50b1d7b7cb55e94c1793": "Bloody hell... You got them all by yourself? You've got guts, that's for sure. Somethin' ain't right about those psychos, I'm tellin' you...",
    "60ed50b1d7b7cb55e94c1796": "Oi, come here, need to talk to you. Got a job for you, a dry one, if you ask me. My folks were looking for loot at night recently and ran into some hooded morons, and, well, shit went south. Naturally, my dudes managed to retreat in the end and even smoked some of those psychos, though we still lost around a dozen of ours. Eh, that's not the point. The guys found some kind of a dagger on one of those psychos, and apparently, some serious people are willing to pay a fortune for those. Anyway, I've got an order for those daggers. If you find any, bring'em here.",
    "60ed50d671035f300c301b13": "There you go, that's way better. Thank you, warrior. The guys are saying it's calmed down now, so looks like the morons understood your message.",
    "60ed50d671035f300c301b16": "Greetings. There's quite a noticeable increase in the number of Scavs, have you noticed? Noticeable so much that my couriers can't even get through the previously safe areas, all get clapped indiscriminately, can't even make a deal with them. We need to teach those bastards a lesson so that they piss their pants with any sound of gunshots in a kilometer radius. Shoot as many of those idiots as you can, and so that they know what's going on, get them in a manner they'll realize everything clearly. The shots all have to be in the head, I'll send some info on my channels so that people know who exactly sends the message.",
    "60ed50ff26b88043510e0af9": "All clear now? Good job, warrior. I'll send my guys to get the stuff then.",
    "60ed50ff26b88043510e0afc": "Hey there, warrior. Listen, I have a mission for you. The other day I was informed that PMCs have captured several Scav bases in the region, and they say there are tons of goods there. Can you help the old soldier? Kill those PMCs so that my dogs could grab the loot without any issues. There are three bases in total: the big fortified building on the construction site on Customs, the former EMERCOM medical unit on Woods, and the river pier on Shoreline. Clear the places out and let me know when it's done.",
    "60ed512ea664b027ab1441cf": "Ah, here is our hero! Well done, my dogs have already reported that everything went well. Thank you, really helped me out.",
    "60ed512ea664b027ab1441d0": "So you failed, warrior? I've been told that my guys had to get back on their own, they lost a lot of people and couldn't even find much loot either. Alright, I'll forgive you this time. The next group is packing up soon, so if you want to make amends, then go with them.",
    "60ed512ea664b027ab1441d2": "Hello there, warrior. C'mere, I've got a task for you. As you know, I sell various equipment and supplies, and send my people to search for loot throughout whole Tarkov. The thing is, I've got a shit ton of orders right now, and sending my guys into a long raid without proper protection is too dangerous. That's where you come to the rescue. In short, you have to provide a safe passage for them throughout the route, press the local ex-PMCs to not think of attacking the guys. Here, let me show you the route on the map. Memorized it? Good. The catch is that all this needs to be done in one go, my guys will not wait if something happens to you. So come on, warrior, don't let me down.",
    "60f05df686abc00cdc03ab8b": "A brave decision, mercenary.",
    "60f05df686abc00cdc03ab8e": "Greetings, mercenary. As I see, you are not wasting your time and have achieved a lot on your way. Sometimes in life, you know, we have to lose something to achieve something bigger in the end? Not everyone is ready for this. Many aren't willing to take risks in their entire life, they are afraid, they don't believe in themselves. What about you, are you ready for this yourself? Are you ready to sacrifice something of value to achieve a bigger goal?",

If you cooperate with them, you'll have much more of my respect than usual. Let's leave everything you've done in the past and start from scratch regarding your extracts. Keep in touch.",
    "6183c6de7289b24d9b6aa89f": "Good afternoon, soldier. I've got a task for you, I advise you not to postpone it. You've heard about the water treatment plant at the coast? No, not the one at the health resort, that one is a power station. I'm talking about the one at Cape Dalniy. So, somewhere on the treatment plant's territory, there is a military MI-8, might even be working. If shit goes south in the city, you could try to start it and get the hell out of here. Anyway, I need it for different reasons: there's a gold mine of army supply crates next to it. I guess the owners didn't have time to load it all before leaving. I don't know who and why left that heli there, but my sources say that there's a craplot of valuable goods. Bring a signal marker and mark the bird, my people will deal with it after. The job is simple but important. Off you go then.",

There were some morons who tried playing tough guys, but they didn't cause much trouble. A pity we couldn't interrogate them. If you know anything about them - let me know. And thanks again for the cooperation and all that, now we're back to the usual respect you get for helping my people.",
    "6183c91b70229a447f7bdafe": "Welcome back. Alright, I'll tell you what's going on. According to rumors, that water treatment plant is a home base of some aggressive western spec ops guys. The fact that you returned tells me that either those guys aren't home at the moment, or there's something you're not telling me. Well, in any case, my scouts said they've spotted Scavs at the helipad - looks like they found out about the supplies. The cargo from that heli is very valuable, but there's no point in sending in my people for a gunfight. Return to the helicopter and clean everything up there so that no bastard would slip away with the cargo.",

The other day, I sent a group of workers to collect supplies in the Cape Dalniy area, to the former USEC base of operations in the cottage area. I think you are more than familiar with this place, given the nature of your work. This mission is vital to getting supplies out of this zone. Unfortunately, the group has ceased all communication since yesterday. We suspect someone found out about our operation. Please, mercenary, find my people and, most importantly, their cargo.",
    "61332c9ad65e4f47f310206d": "So listen up, I'm only telling you this because we got along well, the past places with the stuff are no more relevant. My people removed and stashed almost all the valuables. So keep in mind, look for it elsewhere on the locations.",

Clear the areas from stray servicemen and tourists, but don't touch my people. You do that, and we'll keep working together.",

So many people died, and not even because of the bullets! In our hard times, you have to prioritize your well-being, not where to find cheaper booze. In any case, today there are noticeably fewer patients, so I suppose they have already finished all the bad alcohol. No more harm from it for good people. I wonder where they got all this vodka...",

He's set up at Cape Dalniy, in that old village, but far from the people - made a nice dugout for himself at the outskirts.

    "61815a329b4a55124433e953": "Did you find it? Well I’ll be damned! A damn good man you are, soldier.",
    "61815a48220b6275fa275ade": "Yes, young man, something is constantly lacking in the time of war... If there is an excess of bandages - there are not enough antibiotics, if there are antibiotics - there are not enough basic food supplies. Let me write down what we need, and perhaps if you stumble upon any of this, can take this with you for us?",

    "61815a5dd7e11e7aca65988a": "Hey, friend, I need your help again. I need to find some items from this list. I know that you’re a busy man, but if you do want to help me, I’d appreciate it if you did it immediately.",

    "6183c6de7289b24d9b6aa8a0": "So you're alive, I see? That's strange. Alright, here's your reward, soldier. Go outside for a couple minutes, breathe in some fresh air - I need to think about something.",
    "6183c91b70229a447f7bdaff": "Good work, warrior. Now, all we have to do is deal with those tourists. Here, soldier, grab your share.",
    "6183cb102163e55e7e648b01": "Hey there, kid, I have bad news. Word reached me that a bunch of scum had settled somewhere on the coast beyond the collapsed tunnel. They do whatever the hell they want, harass the whole territory - like a pack of wild wolves. And it's not even some local bandits, but your former work colleagues. As I understand it, when the whole conflict began, their main base was somewhere on the cape. Unlike you, these do not want to return home, but to plunder our land to the last, those bastards! Get rid of them and be careful, soldier.",
    "6183cb102163e55e7e648b02": "Finally, you're back! I've started to worry. Come, let me at least get you something to eat.",
    "6183ccc7762fbb323e48f51f": "Good afternoon, young man, I have a special assignment for you. Unfortunately, I cannot entrust it to my workers. Knowing your previous feats in searching for data that interests me, you can easily be made into a private investigator! So, there was a person who I had been working closely with, he lived somewhere at the cape Dalniy territory. He always carried a briefcase with him containing his medical studies and research. The issue is that he hasn't been contacting me the last two weeks - I'm starting to worry. If his studies get into the wrong hands, I will have to pay a high price to silence the information spread. Please, mercenary, I am asking you to find my contact's briefcase. He used to drive a red merin sports coupe and was always telling me that he'd love to relax somewhere by the sea, farther away from all the city noise. Are you ready to take on this task, young man?",
    "6183ccc7762fbb323e48f520": "This is brilliant, young man! The data from this laptop can play a high role in my business negotiations!.. Ahem, you can go now, mercenary.",
    "6183cdf37289b24d9b6aa95c": "Hey, what's up. Listen, can you help me out with some stuff? There are rumors that a new trader settled right on the lighthouse island at the cape, and he's got some serious guards with him, like some presidential security. I wanna establish communication with that guy, to cooperate, to make deals, well, you know what I mean. Can you go and contact him and check out the situation? If something doesn't go according to the plan, then come back to me right away, okay? Alright, see ya, brother.",
    "6183cdf37289b24d9b6aa95d": "What an adventure for your ass, that's for sure! Looks like our salesman is not ready to talk business. Alright, I'll think of something.",
    "6183cf382163e55e7e648b54": "So all the workers got executed... I figure the cargo wasn't anywhere near them, mercenary? This is unfortunate. Well, you have completed your task, which means that you are entitled to a reward.",
    "6184065070229a447f7bdfed": "Mercenary, there is work for you. According to our intelligence, after the initial conflict, the former base of your USEC comrades, in the cottage area at Cape Dalniy, was abandoned with a lot of valuable equipment and information that could sponsor the Blue Helmets operations. The only problem is that the entire territory is currently under the control of the Scavs, and I would like to get rid of them, or at least scare them out of this zone so that my people can extract all the necessary resources without combat. This is your task, my friend. Naturally, everything that you have just heard will remain strictly between us. I look forward to your report.",
    "6184065070229a447f7bdfee": "My recon group has already reported your success, mercenary. I think you have earned a generous reward. You're free to go.",
    "6184095013d069487a1de8b8": "Hey friend, I could use some help. It takes an incredible amount of energy to sustain my current activities, especially considering my farm, the one you helped me with resources for. I usually order fuel from other sources, but unfortunately, there is no way to contact the supplier at the moment. Do you think there are still unexhausted fuel tanks left somewhere? I think there should have been something left in the cape area. Can you check it out, mercenary?",
    "6184095013d069487a1de8b9": "Great, mercenary. This information opens up many possibilities for me. I'll gather people to collect the fuel. Thank you very much, friend.",
    "618409ec7289b24d9b6aade1": "Did it ever occur to you that we are living in unique times? As if any secret can easily be revealed, the camera obscura will open up, all you need to do is put in some effort ... Let me explain, my friend. You have already poked around corporate territories, laboratories, offices, and all else. Those places have already been looted to the ground. But do you know where there still might be something interesting? In the offices of the wastewater treatment plant. Yes, that facility was also under TerraGroup. What do I want to find? Fact is, I don't even know myself yet. To begin with, let's try to find out what exactly TerraGroup was doing there. Contaminated water, chemical dump ten times over normal? Anything can open up. Prepare well - I hear there is unusually high activity in that area. Perhaps someone is guarding the territory against prying eyes.",
    "618409ec7289b24d9b6aade2": "So there were some documents? Give'em to me. Let's see ... Stationery delivery, office rent - nothing interesting so far... There it is, chemicals. The \"BLUE ICE\" traces in the water? What is this, some kind of refrigerant? Alright, I'll deal with this, but for now, take yourself a small gift for your efforts. Thanks again, friend.",
    "61840aa77289b24d9b6aadf1": "Ah, mercenary, just when I needed you. You've probably already seen all the military machinery in the USEC operational base area? My clients are willing to provide a reward for materials extracted from those vehicles. I want you to identify the exact location of this machinery and mark it for my subordinates. There should be two vehicles inside the base itself and two heavy ICVs somewhere along the main road near the collapsed tunnel. Have fun, my friend.",
    "61840aa77289b24d9b6aadf2": "Perfect, mercenary. We'll figure out the rest by ourselves, so your help in this matter will no longer be needed. See you later.",
    "61840b2d13d069487a1de8de": "Hey, tactical, come on in! Do you remember that civilian helicopter that was shot down somewhere by the Lighthouse, according to rumors? So, the headache is that on that helicopter was a certain man with an inconspicuous folder, but it, in fact, was very much conspicuous - a lot of money was paid for it. Well, a birdie said the helicopter got shot down somewhere on the way to our meeting point. So here's your task: confirm the helicopter's whereabouts and that the rumors are true. Then find that folder for me, it's extremely important. I've got no idea who could've shot it down, honestly. Who's got the resources for that?.. USECs? I did hear that they took a liking to those cottages near the mountains, so it might be worth checking that area out. Hope those stray westerners didn't nick my goodie.",
    "61840b2d13d069487a1de8df": "Opa, here's my goodie! So, it indeed was in the USEC cottages, you're saying? And the damn chopper was there too? Looks like the rumors were true. I knew it couldn't have gone far. Otherwise, there would've been a big uproar! The USECs had no reason to spread the info through, they were probably waiting for orders from the command, but, well, you know what happened. Alrighty, here's your reward.",
    "61840baa2bc2b368204f691f": "Greetings, comrade. Come on in, come on in. And lock the door behind you. Gonna have a serious talk... It's time to show everyone whose land we're standing on and who's the boss around here. Because there are already more of these tourists than us - everything that's left in Tarkov has been plundered. They turned Norvinsk region into some garbage lot. You agree, right? It's not even about the money, it's about driving those fuckers out from our own land! Although I will make it worth your while anyway, as always. Start by clearing the area near the Lighthouse, and then we will throw them out of our other territories. So, are you in?",
    "61840baa2bc2b368204f6920": "Thank you, warrior. Our homeland won't forget this!",
    "61840c13cd72db639232659b": "Mercenary, are you ready for some serious work? The matter is quite significant and requires high preparation. So, listen: the BEAR PMC operatives have been radically interfering with operations on the coast near the Lighthouse lately. I think you have already encountered them there and may have noticed their increased activity. Your task is to help us to maintain the position of the UN in this city ... Are you well prepared? Eliminating BEAR is not the same as scaring off regular bandits.",
    "61840c13cd72db639232659c": "I hope you understand that such an assignment is not given to just anyone. But the reward is appropriate. Here's what you've earned.",
    "618d19a57a507329860ffe20": "Hello Sherpa! I heard you're helping a lot of rookies out there. It's dangerous, but worthy. You know, I've got something useful lying around here. Here, take it. It's always a pleasure to help a good man. Good luck with your raids!",
    "618d1a137a507329860ffe22": "Hello Sherpa! They say you are one of the best in what you do. Praised by everyone I ask about you. Here, take this as a token of my gratitude and keep it up so that others look up to you. Good luck with your raids!",
    "61c19d0cb00456371a668150": "A job well done, young man.",
    "61e7f17906bf9c6af36b2776": "Welcome back, merc. Hand over the dogtags, I'll pass them to where they need to be.",
    "61e7f59320bc7012d528d3d6": "The best way to finish a day of hard work, wouldn't you say? Hurry up and open it then.",
    "61e7f2d0103e097afe3f6cd5": "So, you want to improve your crappy rep around these parts? Two influential people made a bet on you: can you repeat your success of shooting at everything that moves, but with a specific weapon you are told to use? Lucky for you, the tossed coin didn't fall on a knife, but on a Kalashnikov rifle. A pity, honestly, I'd rather look at you running around with a knife and getting messed up every time. Would be a great redemption arc, wouldn't it? Well, since they've chosen an AK, I made a bet too: that you will handle it. Your targets are the unwanted mercs wandering around some places. So you better not screw up.",
    "6196251075aa0345973f5bcd": "Oh, so you found a note? Hold on, don't open it for now - I'll read it by myself later.",
    "619629f254066129c125b5c3": "Mercenary, we made a breakthrough! Um, let's retire for a couple of minutes. So, the TerraGroup cargo that you found in a secret wall in the Azure Coast sanatorium does not fully comply with the manifests at our disposal. We guess where the cargo was delivered from the sanatorium, but the information is completely classified for now. However, you, mercenary, still play a large role in this case. Your next task in our operation is to find evidence of the TerraGroup cargo on the territory of Cape Dalniy, in the area of ​​the sandy coast. I suppose it is better to start your search from the collapsed tunnel's side. Keep in touch, my friend.",
    "619629f254066129c125b5c4": "So you found the cargo on the shore, exactly in the place where the TerraGroup transports moored? Okay, so they were shipped straight from the bay... Thank you for your work, mercenary. We will contact you about the next stage of our operation when the time is right.",
    "61e7f2d0103e097afe3f6cd6": "You've pleased my friends. Congratulations on your success.",
    "61e7f17906bf9c6af36b2775": "Hello there, mercenary. You really messed up, huh? You know what people are saying about you? You are unreliable and not to be trusted. Simply saying, you're an idiot who shoots without thinking at everything that moves. Well, we all can't be saints, right? I'm the man who can improve your reputation. You just have to show that you wouldn't mind helping Scavs. Eliminate several PMC groups and bring me their dogtags. After that, I'll start new rumors about you, something more interesting.",
    "61e7f4060316a769b2704e45": "You know, doing errands all day is still not enough to improve your poor situation. I think there is an easier way. Bribe the right people and they'll sing praises about how amazing you are. For example, you can compensate the friends of those you killed due to your brain disorder. Something like a wergild for murder in the Middle Ages.",
    "61977502f8e9da247b2bc349": "Come here already. Alright, so along the entire coast of the cape, there is a road, you've probably seen it. My guys use this road to transport merchandise to and from me. Usually, they managed to avoid trouble or calm some particular morons down, but right now it's a damn rat nest there, probably found out about my convoys. They started attacking my guys with full power, can't get through them at all. Go there and lay those whack-jobs down, will you? I'll get something nice for you in return.",
    "61977502f8e9da247b2bc34a": "Good shit, you fucked those morons up properly. Alright, mate, see ya.",
    "61e7f4060316a769b2704e46": "Outstanding. Part of the compensation will go where it needs to go, and the other part will stay with me. Let's say it's for maintaining our cooperation.",
    "61e7f59320bc7012d528d3d5": "Do you want people to think the \"right\" things about you? What do you think of yourself, mercenary? Probably thinking you're a great guy? Thinking you're the future Tarkov Legend, maybe even a hero already? You came here to bow to me, which means that you are nothing more than just an errand boy... I'm serious, you're doing everything you get told to: for money, guns, reputation... What if I told you to wipe my people's asses, for the most pimped-out gun in the whole county? Listen, I'm in a good mood today, so I'll just ask you to bring me a Cuba Libre cocktail. I'll remind you of the ingredients, just in case you've been hit on the head too much to forget such basic things. You'll need rum, coke, lime, and ice. Although... Yeah, you'll be searching for lime the whole decade. I'll make it easier for you: bring me a Jack and Coke.",
    "626bdd87a371ee3a7a3514c6": "Hey there, warrior, I've got an important assignment for you. I won't sugarcoat it, it's pretty dangerous. Not everyone is willing to risk their skin under the noses of the Rogues. Ah, here's the fighting spirit! Yeah, I know, you're a tough guy. Alright, so listen. I want to know the situation on Rogues' defenses. Go to the water treatment plant, climb the roofs, check the mounted weapons. Note every little detail, even things that don't seem that important. Is the task clear, war dog?",
    "626bdda55bef5d7d590bd416": "Now look who we have here. Do you even know what's going on in the city right now? Relax, nobody knows. But you and I are gonna start investigating. First, we gotta find out what air deliveries were made and by whom, things like air deployments before the chaos emerged. Also, that plane that got shot down in the woods is still bugging me. Find me the intel of this kind. I'll hook you up with a general direction so you don't hit a dead end. There was an active radar station at the Lighthouse island. It must have all the intel we need, so you gotta check the commandant's office. After that, I'll take the lead. Oh, also, not a word to anyone about this, okay? It's shady stuff, you know what I mean.",
    "626bdda55bef5d7d590bd417": "Fuck's sake, it's all encrypted. Need to call the four-eyes again. Alright, you've done your part of the deal as agreed. I'll figure something out what to do with this crap.",
    "626bddcb05f287031503c7f7": "Good day to you, soldier. Though could I actually say it's good? As a wise person used to say, people are made to torment each other. When I first read it, I didn't honestly believe it. But now my heart bleeds every time I remember this quote. Some new renegades are terrorizing the city. I've sent a man to negotiate with them, maybe even guide them to the right path, but those savages decapitated him and sent his head back to me, with the letter I wrote for them... They're not locals, all came from USEC. Long renounced from their own people too. They must be hunted down. This is our land. No more peace talks.",
    "626bddcb05f287031503c7f8": "Don't think about your hands getting bloody again, soldier. Think that you have cleared this land of the wicked.",
    "61c195e42720935cc2778f4d": "Hello there, happy holidays to you! So, how are you? Gonna celebrate? I've recently heard some rumors that the local bandits are gathering around Christmas trees, even hiding gifts there, would you imagine? They won't even shoot at you on sight, it's holidays, after all! Although, who knows... Listen, can you go there and check it out? And then I'll send my people to inspect the gifts themselves after.",
    "61c195e42720935cc2778f4e": "That was a clever idea, honestly. Alright, I'll send people to those trees a bit later. Thank you for the help.",
    "61c1970b20ae5c2a4d44e26c": "Wanna hear something hilarious? People suddenly became interested in all this Christmas stuff now: hats, white beards, all that. Who the hell would need that in war times? Next will be Scavs dancing and singing around campfires, and Killa with Glukhar collecting gifts from under the tree like good children they are! Hahaha! Well, anyway, I don't really care why everyone needs all that stuff. If people buy it - we make money on it. Bring me anything you find, and I'll give you some Christmas presents in return.",
    "61c1970b20ae5c2a4d44e26d": "Awesome, awesome. Let's dress some people up, here.",
    "61c197ebd6bef04a674cba56": "Come on in, kid. I've seen lots of things during this conflict, but bribes... Someone bribed the local bandit leaders, others found out about it and started doing that too, then the others. Cowards fill the leaders' pockets with goods, and now we have a whole charade of arse-licking around us. They're using those red backpacks to carry all those bribes, like some Christmas presents. They're ruining such an important symbol! Go there and confiscate these bribes from those corrupt bandit leaders.",
    "61c197ebd6bef04a674cba57": "You showed those bastards what's right, kid? That's for the best.",
    "61c198eef735360c9552574b": "Oi, tactical, c'mere, let's talk. Those damn Scav chumps don't wanna do errands for me, only drinking and singing and dancing. In my times, when a prison cook snuck some mayo to fill my instant noodles on Christmas, this used to be a damn celebration of a lifetime for me. And now those crackheads are having fun just for the sake of it. Makes me damn sick. Go show those morons who's the boss around these parts. Show them what happens to ass-sitters during working hours. Oh, and if you see any tourists and shit, take'em out as well - it's not a damn kids' party here.",
    "61c198eef735360c9552574c": "Don't know what you did to those idiots, but my workers are very excited for more labor now! Good stuff, mate.",
    "61c19a442ecf5e52b12f9448": "Merry Christmas, mercenary. As you have probably noticed, the BEARs are becoming bothersome for us. There isn't a single day when brave USEC soldiers sent on a mission return as caskets. Do you think they were killed by Scavs, or maybe Bosses? You are mistaken. BEARs are planning something. There are especially many reports of assassins dressed as a certain \"Ded Moroz\". Who is that, you ask? That's what they call their local Santa Claus, more precisely, his evil counterpart. We suspect that these attacks are not coincidental, but a whole ideological movement aimed to remove the UN from here! We must show that we do not take BEAR seriously and are ready to put forward countermeasures. Put on your Santa Claus hat and lay down some enemies.",
    "61c19a442ecf5e52b12f9449": "Amazing, mercenary, the job is done. Here is your reward.",
    "61c19abf7578f770c5341e9c": "Heard the news, warrior? Those USECs are getting bold. Walking around like they own the place, shoot anyone on sight. What's even worse is that they got more active right with New Year approaching. What do they want to tell with this? That every soldier we lose is a gift to their UN occupants? I'm asking you to fulfill your duty and avenge your fallen brothers. Oh, and put on your Ded Moroz hat. I'll instruct some of your colleagues too. So that when people start asking who's tearing down the USEC ranks, everyone would answer \"Hell knows, might as well be Ded Moroz!\"",
    "61c19abf7578f770c5341e9d": "Serves them right, that's what you get for killing our people. Grab your reward.",
    "61c19b397578f770c5341ea1": "Have you heard of the recent commotion, mercenary? The soldiers are not only killing bandits but now even ones of their own! Too much celebratory vodka or something? Or some patriotic movements... Well, it doesn't matter. I have sent a USEC mercenary to guard a group of valuable refugees, but he got killed by our fellow countrymen. Just because he was a USEC! Well, they are to blame as well: they shot my hired BEARs on another mission. All my plans went to waste! The survivors say that the most aggressive ones were wearing Santa Claus and Ded Moroz hats. Please, mercenary, get rid of them all.",
    "61c19b397578f770c5341ea2": "Excellent, I think further financial damage can be prevented. You deserve a reward.",
    "61c19c4af735360c95525750": "Hey there, come on in. Take a look at my place. Almost like it's missing something, right? It's missing coziness, friend. I want it to be like in the good old times - a New Year's tree, lights, ornaments, a table with food. Maybe you've found anything like that? No-no, I don't mean salads and champagne. But maybe the tree ornaments? Oh, and happy holidays to you!",
    "61c19c4af735360c95525751": "Thank you, friend. Will at least have something to decorate the house for the holidays... What about you? Did you get anything for yourself?",
    "61c19d0cb00456371a66814f": "Greetings, mercenary! I just thought, maybe we should try to negotiate with the leaders of the Scavs? Christmas is a great occasion. Here's what I suggest: let's put the gift under the tree in a place where the leader can get it. But it needs to be so that the bandits understand who the gift is from. Let them figure out with whom it is more profitable to be friends than to fight... I hope you understand me.",
    "61c19e4fdfd64163ea78fbef": "Did I tell you I hate all this Christmas commotion? It's like it's not fighters around us but some kindergarteners, damn them all! Listen, do something for me: dress up as those fairy tale bastards - a Fake white beard, Santa or Ded Moroz hat, Santa's bag, all that stuff. And then mess up some morons. Let everyone know that the only gifts they'll get are bullets in their skulls or slit throats.",
    "61c19e4fdfd64163ea78fbf0": "No celebrations on my watch. Good shit, merc, take a little gift for that.",

    "61e7f937442d0e1cc1085b45": "What, came to bow again, tormented by guilt? You know, merc, I'm not your image-maker or a PR manager... Alright, I can help you. One of my contacts is a big shot who collects US weaponry. Yes, he could just order fresh ones from the factory. But he needs an already used weapon, the one that still smells of gunpowder. That's why his whole collection is guns from conflict zones. Afghanistan, Iraq,... Tarkov. I want to gift him some of the local M4s, but the guy is smart, so you'll need to find the guns yourself, not from some trader. Help me, and I'll help you in return. I'll make people forget the Scav blood on your hands.",

    "626bdd7c166d7709150c88c5": "Come on in, mercenary. I have a high suspicion that someone opened a new drug distribution point or even a whole drug laboratory in Tarkov. How do I know this? First of all, I've treated many people with somewhat familiar symptoms recently. Dilated pupils, tremors, confusion, and so on. Now secondly, my people who were evacuating the refugees from the city, noticed suspicious people near the containers in the Lighthouse territory. One of my men wanted to investigate and almost got killed. They definitely guard that place. Can you find it and place a camera overlooking the place? I'm not asking to tear down the place or eliminate those so-called cooks. Do you understand me? Do not risk your life for nothing. For now, I only need the recordings from the cameras.",

People are saying there's a live broadcast going somewhere in the city. They say that someone is performing surgeries and filming it on their camera. I'd understand if it was an actually good willed doctor helping people. I would even understand if there was an organ trade, although that in itself is disgusting. But tell me, why stream this? Is this a kink for some perverted oligarchs? I honestly don't have an answer. But I do know that this broadcast must be shut down. Can you put a jammer near them?",

This one is a classic TT-33, the most mass-produced version.

Thanks to the powerful 7.62x25 cartridge and relatively long barrel, the TT boasts high muzzle velocity, penetration, and impressive accuracy, even over long distances."
